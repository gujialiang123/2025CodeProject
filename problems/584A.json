  "description": "Olesya loves numbers consisting of n digits, and Rodion only likes numbers that are divisible by t. Find some number that satisfies both of them.\n\nYour task is: given the n and t print an integer strictly larger than zero consisting of n digits that is divisible by t. If such number doesn't exist, print -1.\n\nInput\nThe single line contains two numbers, n and t (1≤n≤100, 2≤t≤10) — the length of the number and the number it should be divisible by.\n\nOutput\nPrint one such positive number without leading zeroes, — the answer to the problem, or -1, if such number doesn't exist. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.",
