### Solution: Calculating the Total Hours of Candlelight

To find the total hours of candlelight, we can use a mathematical approach. We'll start with the initial number of candles and calculate how many new candles can be created from the burned-out candles.

#### Problem Analysis

Given:
- `a`: The initial number of candles.
- `b`: The number of burned-out candles required to make a new candle.

Objective:
Find the total hours of candlelight if Vasily acts optimally well.

#### Solution

We'll use the following steps to solve the problem:

1. Initialize the total hours of candlelight with the number of hours the initial candles can burn (which is `a`).
2. Calculate the number of new candles that can be created from the burned-out candles. We'll use a while loop to simulate this process.
3. Inside the loop, calculate the number of new candles that can be created from the burned-out candles.
4. Add the hours that the new candles can burn to the total hours.
5. Update the number of burned-out candles.

#### Code

```python
def calculate_total_hours(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the total hours of candlelight.

    Args:
    a (int): The initial number of candles.
    b (int): The number of burned-out candles required to make a new candle.

    Returns:
    int: The total hours of candlelight.
    """
    total_hours = a  # Initialize the total hours with the number of hours the initial candles can burn
    burned_candles = a  # Initialize the number of burned-out candles with the initial number of candles

    while burned_candles >= b:
        # Calculate the number of new candles that can be created from the burned-out candles
        new_candles = burned_candles // b
        
        # Add the hours that the new candles can burn to the total hours
        total_hours += new_candles
        
        # Update the number of burned-out candles
        burned_candles = new_candles + (burned_candles % b)
    
    return total_hours

# Example usage
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(calculate_total_hours(a, b))
```

#### Explanation

The provided code calculates the total hours of candlelight by simulating the process of burning candles and creating new candles from the burned-out ones. The `calculate_total_hours` function takes the initial number of candles `a` and the number of burned-out candles required to make a new candle `b` as input and returns the total hours of candlelight.

In the example usage, we read the input values `a` and `b` from the console, call the `calculate_total_hours` function, and print the result.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is O(n), where n is the number of iterations required to burn all the candles. In each iteration, we perform a constant amount of work, so the overall time complexity is linear.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the provided solution is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input. We only use a constant amount of space to store the variables `total_hours`, `burned_candles`, and `new_candles`.
