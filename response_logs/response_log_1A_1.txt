To solve this problem, we'll first import the necessary module, define the variables, and then calculate the minimum number of flagstones needed to cover the Theatre Square.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
import math

def calculate_flagstones(n, m, a):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of flagstones needed to cover the Theatre Square.

    Args:
        n (int): Length of the Theatre Square.
        m (int): Width of the Theatre Square.
        a (int): Side length of each flagstone.

    Returns:
        int: Minimum number of flagstones needed.
    """
    # Calculate the number of flagstones needed to cover the length and width of the Square
    length_flagstones = math.ceil(n / a)
    width_flagstones = math.ceil(m / a)

    # The minimum number of flagstones needed is the product of the number of flagstones needed to cover the length and width
    min_flagstones = length_flagstones * width_flagstones

    return min_flagstones

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Read input from the user
    n, m, a = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate and print the minimum number of flagstones needed
    min_flagstones = calculate_flagstones(n, m, a)
    print(min_flagstones)

```

Here's an explanation of the code:

1.  We import the math module to use the ceil function, which returns the smallest integer not less than the given number.
2.  We define a function calculate_flagstones that takes the length (n), width (m), and flagstone side length (a) as arguments.
3.  Inside the function, we calculate the number of flagstones needed to cover the length and width of the Theatre Square using the ceil function. This is because we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure complete coverage.
4.  The minimum number of flagstones needed is the product of the number of flagstones needed to cover the length and width.
5.  In the main part of the code, we read the input values from the user, calculate the minimum number of flagstones needed using the calculate_flagstones function, and print the result.

Example usage:

*   Input: `6 6 4`
*   Output: `4`
*   Explanation: The Theatre Square has a size of 6x6 meters, and each flagstone has a size of 4x4 meters. To cover the Square, you would need 4 flagstones (2 rows and 2 columns).

You can run this code with different input values to see how it calculates the minimum number of flagstones needed for various Theatre Square sizes and flagstone sizes.

**Theatre Square Problem Solution**

### Problem Description
The problem is to determine the minimum number of square flagstones required to pave a rectangular Theatre Square with dimensions `n x m` using flagstones of size `a x a`. The flagstones must cover the entire square, and it is acceptable to cover a larger area than the square, but not allowed to break the flagstones.

### Solution

To find the minimum number of flagstones needed, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the number of flagstones required to cover the length of the square (`n`).
2. Calculate the number of flagstones required to cover the width of the square (`m`).
3. Multiply the results from steps 1 and 2 to get the total number of flagstones needed.

We can calculate the number of flagstones required to cover the length and width by dividing the length and width of the square by the size of the flagstone and rounding up to the nearest integer using the ceiling function. In most programming languages, this can be achieved using the `math.ceil` function.

Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented code solution in Python:

```python
import math

def calculate_flagstones(n, m, a):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of flagstones required to pave a rectangular Theatre Square.
    
    Args:
    n (int): Length of the Theatre Square.
    m (int): Width of the Theatre Square.
    a (int): Size of each flagstone.
    
    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of flagstones required.
    """
    # Calculate the number of flagstones required to cover the length
    flagstones_length = math.ceil(n / a)
    
    # Calculate the number of flagstones required to cover the width
    flagstones_width = math.ceil(m / a)
    
    # Calculate the total number of flagstones required
    total_flagstones = flagstones_length * flagstones_width
    
    return total_flagstones

# Read input from the user
n, m, a = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the result
result = calculate_flagstones(n, m, a)
print(result)
```

This solution works by calculating the number of flagstones required to cover the length and width of the square, then multiplying these values together to get the total number of flagstones needed.

### Example Use Case
For example, if the input is `6 6 4`, the output will be `4`, because we can pave the square with 4 flagstones of size `4 x 4` each (2 flagstones in each direction).

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1), because it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the input and output values.
