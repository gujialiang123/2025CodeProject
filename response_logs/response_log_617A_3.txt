**Solution: Minimum Number of Steps for the Elephant**
======================================================

### Problem Statement

Determine the minimum number of steps an elephant needs to take to reach his friend's house located at point `x` (where `x > 0`) on the coordinate line, given that the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward in one step.

### Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm approach. The idea is to always move the maximum possible distance (5 positions) towards the friend's house until it's no longer possible. Then, we move the maximum remaining distance that doesn't exceed the distance to the friend's house.

### Code Solution

```python
import math

def min_steps_to_friend(x):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of steps an elephant needs to take to reach his friend's house.

    Args:
        x (int): The coordinate of the friend's house (where x > 0).

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of steps needed.
    """
    # Move as many groups of 5 as possible
    groups_of_5 = math.floor(x / 5)
    remaining_distance = x % 5

    # Add the remaining distance as steps
    if remaining_distance > 0:
        remaining_steps = 1  # Can always move 1-4 remaining positions in one step
    else:
        remaining_steps = 0

    return groups_of_5 + remaining_steps

# Example usage:
x = int(input("Enter the coordinate of the friend's house: "))
min_steps = min_steps_to_friend(x)
print("Minimum number of steps:", min_steps)
```

### Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function `min_steps_to_friend(x)` that calculates the minimum number of steps an elephant needs to reach his friend's house located at coordinate `x`.

1.  **Move as many groups of 5 as possible**: We divide the total distance `x` by 5 and take the floor of this division to find out how many complete groups of 5 positions we can move. This gives us the `groups_of_5` variable.
2.  **Calculate the remaining distance**: We calculate the remaining distance by finding the remainder of `x` divided by 5 (`x % 5`). This gives us the distance that's not covered by moving in groups of 5.
3.  **Add the remaining distance as steps**: If there's a remaining distance, we can always cover it in one step (since we can move 1, 2, 3, or 4 positions in one step). So, we add 1 to the total number of steps if there's a remaining distance.
4.  **Return the total minimum steps**: We return the sum of `groups_of_5` and the steps needed to cover the remaining distance (which is either 0 or 1).

### Example Use Cases

*   If `x = 10`, the elephant can move 2 groups of 5, so the minimum number of steps is 2.
*   If `x = 7`, the elephant can move 1 group of 5 and then move 2 positions in the next step, so the minimum number of steps is 2.
*   If `x = 3`, the elephant can directly move 3 positions in one step, so the minimum number of steps is 1.

The provided code efficiently calculates the minimum number of steps required for any given `x` using this approach.

## Solution to the Elephant Movement Problem
### Problem Overview
The problem states that an elephant starts at point 0 and needs to reach point x, where x is a positive integer. In one step, the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward. We need to determine the minimum number of steps required for the elephant to reach its friend's house.

### Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create an array where the index represents the position on the coordinate line, and the value at that index will represent the minimum number of steps required to reach that position.

### Code Solution
```python
def min_steps_to_reach_friend(x):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of steps required for the elephant to reach its friend's house.
    
    Parameters:
    x (int): The coordinate of the friend's house.
    
    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house.
    """
    # Create an array to store the minimum number of steps required to reach each position
    dp = [float('inf')] * (x + 1)
    
    # The elephant can reach position 0 in 0 steps
    dp[0] = 0
    
    # Iterate over each position from 1 to x
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        # Check all possible steps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that can reach the current position
        for step in range(1, 6):
            # If the previous position is within the bounds of the array
            if i - step >= 0:
                # Update the minimum number of steps required to reach the current position
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - step] + 1)
    
    # Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house
    return dp[x]

# Example usage:
x = int(input("Enter the coordinate of the friend's house: "))
min_steps = min_steps_to_reach_friend(x)
print("Minimum number of steps required:", min_steps)
```
### Explanation
The provided code solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum number of steps required for the elephant to reach its friend's house.

1.  We initialize an array `dp` with a size of `x + 1`, where `x` is the coordinate of the friend's house. The array is filled with infinity values, representing that we don't know the minimum number of steps required to reach each position yet.
2.  We set `dp[0]` to 0, as the elephant can reach position 0 in 0 steps.
3.  We iterate over each position from 1 to `x` and check all possible steps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that can reach the current position.
4.  For each step, we update the minimum number of steps required to reach the current position by taking the minimum of the current value and the number of steps required to reach the previous position plus 1.
5.  Finally, we return the minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house, which is stored in `dp[x]`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(x) and a space complexity of O(x), making it efficient for large inputs.

Here is a complete solution to the problem:

**Minimum Number of Steps for the Elephant to Reach its Friend's House**

The problem is to find the minimum number of steps for the elephant to reach its friend's house, located at point x (x > 0) on the coordinate line, starting from point 0. The elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward in one step.

### Algorithm

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm approach. The idea is to divide the distance to the friend's house (x) by the maximum step size (5) and calculate the minimum number of steps required.

### Code

```python
def min_steps(x):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of steps for the elephant to reach its friend's house.

    Args:
    x (int): The coordinate of the friend's house.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of steps required.
    """
    return (x + 4) // 5

# Read the input from the user
x = int(input())

# Calculate and print the minimum number of steps
print(min_steps(x))
```

### Explanation

The code works as follows:

1. Read the input coordinate `x` from the user.
2. Calculate the minimum number of steps using the formula `(x + 4) // 5`.
3. Print the result.

The formula `(x + 4) // 5` works because we want to divide `x` by 5 as many times as possible without exceeding `x`. Adding 4 to `x` ensures that we round up to the nearest multiple of 5, which is equivalent to taking the ceiling of `x/5`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the result.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1), as it only involves a constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1), as we only use a constant amount of memory to store the input and output values.

### Example Use Cases

* Input: `x = 10`
Output: `2` (because the elephant can move 5 steps forward twice to reach point 10)
* Input: `x = 13`
Output: `3` (because the elephant can move 5 steps forward twice and then 3 steps forward to reach point 13)
* Input: `x = 100`
Output: `20` (because the elephant can move 5 steps forward 20 times to reach point 100)

Note that this solution assumes that the input `x` is a positive integer. If `x` can be negative or a non-integer, additional error handling may be necessary.
