**Minimum Steps to Reach Friend's House**
=====================================================

**Problem Statement**
--------------------

An elephant wants to visit his friend's house located at point `x` (`x > 0`) on the coordinate line. The elephant can move `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5` positions forward in a single step. The goal is to determine the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to reach his friend's house.

**Solution**
------------

This problem can be solved using a simple mathematical approach. Since the elephant can move `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5` positions forward, we can divide the distance `x` by `5` and round up to the nearest integer. This will give us the minimum number of steps required.

**Code Solution**
----------------

Here is a Python code snippet that solves the problem:
```python
import math

def min_steps_to_reach_friend(x):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to reach his friend's house.

    Args:
        x (int): The coordinate of the friend's house.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of steps required.
    """
    return math.ceil(x / 5)

# Example usage:
x = int(input())  # Read the coordinate of the friend's house
min_steps = min_steps_to_reach_friend(x)
print(min_steps)  # Print the minimum number of steps required
```
**Explanation**
--------------

In the code above, we define a function `min_steps_to_reach_friend` that takes the coordinate `x` as an input. We use the `math.ceil` function to divide `x` by `5` and round up to the nearest integer. This gives us the minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house.

**Example Use Cases**
--------------------

* Input: `x = 10`
Output: `2` (minimum number of steps required: `5 + 5 = 10`)
* Input: `x = 7`
Output: `2` (minimum number of steps required: `5 + 2 = 7`)
* Input: `x = 3`
Output: `1` (minimum number of steps required: `3`)

Note: This solution assumes that the elephant can only move forward and cannot move backward.
