### Problem Solution: Bear and Brother

#### Problem Description
The problem requires us to find the number of full years it will take for Limak's weight to exceed his brother Bob's weight. Limak's weight triples every year, and Bob's weight doubles every year.

#### Solution Approach
We can solve this problem by comparing the weights of Limak and Bob over time, starting from the initial year. The process involves tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight for each subsequent year until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.

#### Code Solution

```python
def years_until_limak_exceeds_bob(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the number of full years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.

    Args:
        a (int): Limak's initial weight
        b (int): Bob's initial weight

    Returns:
        int: The number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight
    """
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3  # Limak's weight triples every year
        b *= 2  # Bob's weight doubles every year
        years += 1
    return years

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(years_until_limak_exceeds_bob(a, b))
```

#### Explanation
1.  The `years_until_limak_exceeds_bob` function takes Limak's initial weight `a` and Bob's initial weight `b` as arguments.
2.  We use a `while` loop to simulate the years passing, tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight in each iteration.
3.  The loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight (`a > b`).
4.  The number of years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight is returned by the function.
5.  The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with input weights `a` and `b` and print the result.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(log(b/a)) because the weights are multiplied by constants in each iteration. However, since the input weights are limited to a maximum value of 10, the time complexity is effectively O(1) for this specific problem.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) because we use a constant amount of space to store the weights and the year counter, regardless of the input size.

**Problem Solution: Limak and Bob**
=====================================

**Problem Statement**
-------------------

Limak and Bob are bears with initial weights `a` and `b`, respectively. Limak's weight triples every year, while Bob's weight doubles every year. We need to find the number of full years it takes for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob.

**Solution**
------------

We can solve this problem by simulating the weight changes of Limak and Bob over the years.

### Code Solution (Python)
```python
def limak_and_bob(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the number of full years it takes for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob.

    Args:
    a (int): Initial weight of Limak
    b (int): Initial weight of Bob

    Returns:
    int: Number of full years
    """
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3  # Limak's weight triples
        b *= 2  # Bob's weight doubles
        years += 1
    return years

# Example usage:
a, b = map(int, input().split())  # Read input
print(limak_and_bob(a, b))  # Print result
```

**Explanation**
--------------

1. We define a function `limak_and_bob` that takes the initial weights `a` and `b` as input.
2. We initialize a variable `years` to 0, which will store the number of full years.
3. We enter a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`.
4. Inside the loop, we update the weights of Limak and Bob by tripling and doubling them, respectively.
5. We increment the `years` variable by 1 for each iteration.
6. Once the loop exits (i.e., Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight), we return the `years` variable.
7. In the example usage, we read the input weights `a` and `b`, call the `limak_and_bob` function, and print the result.

**Example Use Cases**
--------------------

* Input: `a = 1`, `b = 10`
Output: `1`
* Input: `a = 2`, `b = 2`
Output: `1`
* Input: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
Output: `1`
