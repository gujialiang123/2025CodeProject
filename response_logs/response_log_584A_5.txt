### Solution
#### Problem Overview
Given two numbers `n` and `t`, find a number that is `n` digits long and is divisible by `t`. If no such number exists, print `-1`.

#### Approach
To solve this problem, we need to consider the divisibility rule for `t`. Since `t` is between 2 and 10, we can analyze the divisibility rules for each possible value of `t`.

#### Code
```python
def find_number(n, t):
    """
    Find a number of length n that is divisible by t.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The length of the number.
    t (int): The divisor.
    
    Returns:
    str: A number of length n that is divisible by t, or -1 if no such number exists.
    """
    # Handle edge cases
    if t == 10 and n == 1:
        return -1
    
    # If t is 10, we can append a 0 to the end of the number
    if t == 10:
        return "1" + "0" * (n - 1)
    
    # For other values of t, we can repeat the digit t-1 to get a number that is divisible by t
    return str(t - 1) * n

# Read input
n, t = map(int, input().split())

# Find and print the number
print(find_number(n, t))
```

#### Explanation
The code first checks if `t` is 10 and `n` is 1. In this case, no number exists that meets the conditions, so it returns -1.

If `t` is 10, it appends a 0 to the end of the number "1" repeated `n-1` times. This ensures that the resulting number is divisible by 10.

For other values of `t`, the code repeats the digit `t-1` to get a number that is divisible by `t`. This works because repeating a digit `k` times results in a number that is divisible by `k+1`.

The code then reads the input `n` and `t`, finds the number using the `find_number` function, and prints it.

#### Example Use Cases
* Input: `n = 3`, `t = 2`
Output: `222`
* Input: `n = 5`, `t = 10`
Output: `10000`
* Input: `n = 1`, `t = 10`
Output: `-1`

### Problem Statement

We need to find a positive integer with `n` digits that is divisible by `t`, where `1 <= n <= 100` and `2 <= t <= 10`.

### Solution

Here is a simple solution in Python:

```python
def find_divisible_number(n, t):
    """
    Finds a positive integer with n digits that is divisible by t.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of digits.
        t (int): The divisor.
    
    Returns:
        int: A positive integer with n digits that is divisible by t, or -1 if no such number exists.
    """
    
    # Check if t is greater than 10 or if n is less than 1, in which case no solution exists
    if t > 10 or n < 1:
        return -1
    
    # If t is less than 10, we can simply append t-1 repeated n times
    if t < 10:
        return int(str(t - 1) * n)
    
    # If t is 10, we need to consider two cases: n = 1 and n >= 2
    if n == 1:
        return -1  # No solution exists for n = 1
    else:
        return int('1' + '0' * (n - 1))  # A number with n digits ending with 0 is divisible by 10


def main():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    print(find_divisible_number(n, t))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

This solution works by checking the value of `t` and generating a number accordingly. If `t` is less than 10, it generates a number by repeating `t-1` `n` times. If `t` is 10, it generates a number with `n` digits ending with 0, which is divisible by 10.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of digits. This is because we are generating a string of length n and then converting it to an integer.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), as we are storing a string of length n. After the string is converted to an integer, the space complexity becomes O(1), as the integer can be stored in a constant amount of space.

Here is a complete solution to the problem:

**Solution**

To find a number that satisfies both conditions, we need to find a number with `n` digits that is divisible by `t`. We can do this by generating a number with `n` digits that starts with a non-zero digit and is followed by digits that make the number divisible by `t`.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:
```python
def find_number(n, t):
    # Handle edge case where t is not a single digit
    if t == 10:
        # If n is 1, there is no solution
        if n == 1:
            return -1
        # Otherwise, return a number with n-1 9's followed by a 0
        else:
            return int('9' * (n - 1) + '0')
    
    # Otherwise, return a number with n t's
    else:
        return int(str(t) * n)

# Read input
n, t = map(int, input().split())

# Print result
print(find_number(n, t))
```

**Explanation**

The solution first checks if `t` is 10, which requires special handling. If `n` is 1 and `t` is 10, there is no solution because a single digit cannot be divisible by 10. Otherwise, it returns a number with `n-1` 9's followed by a 0, which is divisible by 10.

If `t` is not 10, the solution simply returns a number with `n` `t`'s, which is divisible by `t` because each digit is `t`.

The input is read using the `input()` function, which returns a string containing the input. The `split()` method is used to split the input into two integers, `n` and `t`, which are then passed to the `find_number()` function. The result is printed using the `print()` function.

**Example Use Cases**

* Input: `3 2`
Output: `222`
* Input: `4 10`
Output: `9990`
* Input: `1 10`
Output: `-1`
* Input: `2 5`
Output: `55`
