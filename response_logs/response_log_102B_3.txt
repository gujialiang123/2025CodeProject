**Solution**
===============

### Problem Statement

Given a number `n` as a string, find out how many times we need to apply the spell that turns any number into the sum of its digits until it becomes a single digit.

### Approach

1. Initialize a counter to store the number of times the spell is applied.
2. Convert the input number to a string to handle large numbers.
3. While the length of the string is greater than 1, apply the spell and increment the counter.
4. Return the counter.

### Code

```python
def count_spells(n):
    """
    Count the number of times a spell needs to be applied to a number
    until it becomes a single digit.

    Args:
    n (str): The input number as a string.

    Returns:
    int: The number of times the spell needs to be applied.
    """
    count = 0
    while len(n) > 1:
        # Calculate the sum of digits
        n = str(sum(int(digit) for digit in n))
        count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
n = input()
print(count_spells(n))
```

### Explanation

1. The `count_spells` function takes a string `n` as input.
2. The `while` loop continues until the length of `n` is greater than 1.
3. Inside the loop, we calculate the sum of digits using a generator expression and convert the result back to a string.
4. We increment the `count` variable each time the spell is applied.
5. Finally, we return the `count` variable.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(m \* n), where m is the number of digits in the input number and n is the number of times the spell needs to be applied. However, since n is typically small (less than 10), we can consider the time complexity to be O(m).
