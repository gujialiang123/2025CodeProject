## Problem Analysis

The problem involves finding the minimum time it takes for Xenia to complete all her tasks in a city with n houses built along a one-way ringroad. Xenia starts at house number 1 and needs to move to specific houses to complete her tasks, with the constraint that she can only move in a clockwise direction. The time it takes to move from one house to a neighboring one is one unit of time.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We'll iterate through the list of tasks and calculate the minimum time it takes to complete each task. The key idea is to keep track of the current house number and the time it takes to reach the next task.

### Code Solution

```python
def min_time_to_complete_tasks(n, m, tasks):
    """
    Calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of houses along the ringroad.
    m (int): The number of tasks Xenia needs to complete.
    tasks (list): A list of house numbers where Xenia needs to complete each task.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks.
    """
    time = 0
    current_house = 1

    for task in tasks:
        # Calculate the distance to the next task
        distance = (task - current_house) % n

        # Update the time and current house number
        time += distance
        current_house = task

    return time


# Example usage
n, m = map(int, input().split())
tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_time = min_time_to_complete_tasks(n, m, tasks)
print(min_time)

```

### Explanation

1.  Initialize the `time` variable to 0 to keep track of the total time.
2.  Initialize the `current_house` variable to 1, which is the starting house number.
3.  Iterate through the list of tasks. For each task, calculate the distance to the next task using the formula `(task - current_house) % n`. The modulo operation (`% n`) ensures that we consider the clockwise direction when calculating the distance.
4.  Update the `time` variable by adding the distance to the next task.
5.  Update the `current_house` variable to the task house number.
6.  After iterating through all tasks, return the `time` variable, which represents the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(m), where m is the number of tasks. We iterate through the list of tasks once, and each iteration involves a constant amount of work.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not grow with the size of the input. We only use a constant amount of space to store the `time`, `current_house`, and other variables, regardless of the input size.
