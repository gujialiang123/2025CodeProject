## Problem Analysis

The problem defines a function `f(n)` as the sum of an alternating series of integers from 1 to `n`, where the sign of each term alternates between positive and negative. The task is to calculate `f(n)` for a given positive integer `n`.

## Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize the properties of geometric sequences. However, the given series is not a geometric sequence itself, but rather an alternating arithmetic sequence. We can still use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and the properties of alternating series to find an efficient solution.

Notice that the series can be paired as follows: `-1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - ... + (-1)^n*n`. When `n` is even, we can pair the terms as `(-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + ... + (-(n-1) + n)`, which simplifies to `1 + 1 + ... + 1` (with `n/2` terms). When `n` is odd, we have an extra term at the end, which is `-n`.

### Formula Derivation

For even `n`, the sum simplifies to `1 * (n/2)`. For odd `n`, we need to subtract the last term from this sum, which is `-n`.

Thus, we can derive the following formula:

- For even `n`, `f(n) = n/2`.
- For odd `n`, `f(n) = (n-1)/2 - n = -(n+1)/2`.

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that each pair contributes `1` to the sum, and then handle the last term separately.

### Implementation

Here is a Python solution that calculates `f(n)` based on the derived formula:

```python
def calculate_f_n(n):
    """
    Calculate the function f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + .. + (-1)^n*n.
    
    Args:
    n (int): A positive integer.
    
    Returns:
    int: The result of f(n).
    """
    if n % 2 == 0:  # n is even
        return n // 2
    else:  # n is odd
        return -(n + 1) // 2

# Read input
n = int(input())

# Calculate and print f(n)
result = calculate_f_n(n)
print(result)
```

### Explanation

- The function `calculate_f_n(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.
- It checks whether `n` is even or odd using the modulus operator (`n % 2 == 0`).
- Depending on whether `n` is even or odd, it returns the corresponding value based on the derived formula.
- The input `n` is read from the user, and then `calculate_f_n(n)` is called with this input.
- The result is printed to the console.

This solution runs in O(1) time, making it efficient for large inputs up to `10^15`.
