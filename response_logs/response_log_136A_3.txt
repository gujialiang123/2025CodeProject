**Solution:**

Here is a complete solution to the problem in Python:
```python
def solve(n, gifts):
    """
    Returns a list of integers representing the number of the friend who gave a gift to each friend.
    
    :param n: The number of friends
    :param gifts: A list of integers representing the friend who received a gift from each friend
    :return: A list of integers representing the number of the friend who gave a gift to each friend
    """
    result = [0] * n
    for i, gift in enumerate(gifts):
        result[gift - 1] = i + 1
    return result

def main():
    n = int(input())  # Read the number of friends
    gifts = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of gifts
    result = solve(n, gifts)  # Solve the problem
    print(*result)  # Print the result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
**Explanation:**

1. The `solve` function takes two inputs: `n` (the number of friends) and `gifts` (a list of integers representing the friend who received a gift from each friend).
2. We create a list `result` of length `n` to store the number of the friend who gave a gift to each friend. We initialize all elements of `result` to 0.
3. We iterate over the `gifts` list, where each element represents the friend who received a gift from the current friend. For each element, we update the corresponding element in `result` with the number of the friend who gave the gift.
4. Finally, we return the `result` list.
5. In the `main` function, we read the number of friends `n` and the list of gifts from the input, and then call the `solve` function to compute the result.
6. We print the result using the `print` function with the `*` operator to separate the elements with spaces.

**Example Use Case:**

Input:
```
3
2 3 1
```
Output:
```
3 1 2
```
Explanation:

* Friend 1 received a gift from friend 3.
* Friend 2 received a gift from friend 1.
* Friend 3 received a gift from friend 2.

Therefore, the output is `[3, 1, 2]`.
