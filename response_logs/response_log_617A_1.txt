**Minimum Steps for Elephant to Reach Friend's House**

### Problem Description

An elephant needs to move from point 0 to point x on a coordinate line, where x > 0. The elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward in one step. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required for the elephant to reach its friend's house at point x.

### Solution

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. However, a simpler approach is to use integer division and modulo operations to calculate the minimum number of steps.

#### Code

```python
def min_steps(x):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of steps for the elephant to reach point x.

    Args:
    x (int): The coordinate of the friend's house.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of steps required to reach point x.
    """
    # Calculate the minimum number of steps by dividing x by 5 and rounding up to the nearest integer
    return (x + 4) // 5

# Read the input
x = int(input())

# Calculate and print the minimum number of steps
print(min_steps(x))
```

#### Explanation

*   The `min_steps` function takes an integer `x` as input and returns the minimum number of steps required to reach point x.
*   The expression `(x + 4) // 5` calculates the minimum number of steps by dividing `x` by 5 and rounding up to the nearest integer. This works because the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward in one step.
*   The `input` function reads the coordinate of the friend's house from the user, and the result is printed to the console.

### Example Use Cases

*   Input: `10`
    Output: `2` (The elephant can move 5 steps forward twice to reach point 10 in 2 steps.)
*   Input: `7`
    Output: `2` (The elephant can move 5 steps forward and then 2 steps forward to reach point 7 in 2 steps.)

This solution provides an efficient and straightforward way to calculate the minimum number of steps for the elephant to reach its friend's house.

**Solution: Minimum Number of Steps for the Elephant**

### Problem Description

The problem requires determining the minimum number of steps an elephant needs to take to reach its friend's house located at point `x` (`x > 0`) from its own house at point `0`. The elephant can move forward 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions in a single step.

### Solution Approach

This problem can be solved using mathematical reasoning and the division algorithm.

### Code Solution (Python)

```python
def min_steps(x: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to reach point x.

    Args:
    x (int): The coordinate of the friend's house.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of steps required.
    """
    # The elephant can move in steps of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
    steps = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    # Initialize the minimum number of steps
    min_num_steps = float('inf')
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of steps by iteratively dividing by 5 and adding the remainder
    remaining_distance = x
    num_steps = 0
    while remaining_distance > 0:
        for step in reversed(steps):
            if remaining_distance >= step:
                remaining_distance -= step
                num_steps += 1
                break
    return num_steps


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    x = int(input())  # Input the coordinate of the friend's house
    min_steps_required = min_steps(x)
    print(min_steps_required)
```

### Explanation

1. **Problem Statement**: The problem asks for the minimum number of steps for an elephant to reach its friend's house at point `x`, where `x > 0`, from its own house at point `0`. The elephant can move forward 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions in a single step.
2. **Solution Approach**: This problem is solved using a greedy algorithm approach. The idea is to maximize the distance covered in each step by choosing the largest possible step that doesn't exceed the remaining distance.
3. **Code Explanation**: The provided Python code implements this greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of steps.
   - It initializes the `min_num_steps` variable to infinity, ensuring that any calculated number of steps will be smaller.
   - The code iteratively calculates the remaining distance after each step, starting from the largest possible step (5) and going down to the smallest step (1).
   - The `while` loop continues until the elephant reaches the friend's house (i.e., the remaining distance becomes `0`).
   - In each iteration of the `while` loop, it tries to subtract the largest possible step from the remaining distance without going into negative. If the remaining distance is greater than or equal to the current step, it subtracts the step and increments the number of steps.
   - Once the loop finishes, the function returns the minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house.

**Key Insight**: The optimal greedy strategy for this problem is to always choose the largest step that doesn't exceed the remaining distance. This approach ensures that the elephant covers the most distance in each step, thereby minimizing the total number of steps needed.
