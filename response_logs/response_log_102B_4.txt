## Solution
Here is a Python solution for the problem. This solution works by continuously replacing the input number with the sum of its digits until a single-digit number is obtained.

```python
def gerald_and_magic_spells(n):
    """
    Calculate the number of times Gerald can put a spell on the number n
    until it becomes a single-digit number.

    Args:
    n (str): The input number as a string.

    Returns:
    int: The number of times the spell can be applied.
    """
    count = 0  # Initialize the count of spell applications

    while len(n) > 1:  # Continue until the number is single-digit
        # Calculate the sum of the digits of the number
        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in n)
        
        # Convert the sum back to a string and update the number
        n = str(digit_sum)
        
        # Increment the count of spell applications
        count += 1

    return count


# Read the input number from the user
input_number = input()

# Calculate and print the result
result = gerald_and_magic_spells(input_number)
print(result)
```

## Explanation
The provided solution works as follows:

1.  **Read the Input Number**: The input number is read from the user as a string to handle arbitrary-precision numbers.
2.  **Initialize the Count**: A variable `count` is initialized to keep track of the number of times the spell is applied.
3.  **Apply the Spell**: The solution enters a loop where it continuously applies the spell until the number becomes single-digit.
4.  **Calculate the Digit Sum**: Inside the loop, the sum of the digits of the current number is calculated by iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting it to an integer, and summing them up.
5.  **Update the Number**: The sum of the digits is converted back to a string and replaces the current number.
6.  **Increment the Count**: The count of spell applications is incremented.
7.  **Repeat or Exit**: The loop continues until the number becomes single-digit (i.e., its length is 1). At this point, the loop exits, and the function returns the count of spell applications.
8.  **Print the Result**: Finally, the result (the count of spell applications) is printed.

This solution is efficient, as it uses string manipulation to handle large numbers and avoids the performance issues associated with Python's int type for very large integers.
