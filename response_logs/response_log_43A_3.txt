To solve this problem, we will write a Python program that takes the number of goals as input and then reads the names of the teams that scored each goal. We will keep track of the number of goals scored by each team and finally print out the name of the team with the most goals.

Here is a complete solution in Python:
```python
# Read the number of goals
n = int(input())

# Initialize an empty dictionary to store the number of goals scored by each team
team_goals = {}

# Read the name of the team that scored each goal
for _ in range(n):
    team_name = input()
    # If the team is already in the dictionary, increment its goal count
    if team_name in team_goals:
        team_goals[team_name] += 1
    # If the team is not in the dictionary, add it with a goal count of 1
    else:
        team_goals[team_name] = 1

# Find the team with the most goals
winning_team = max(team_goals, key=team_goals.get)

# Print the name of the winning team
print(winning_team)
```
This program uses a dictionary to store the number of goals scored by each team. The `max` function with the `key` argument is used to find the team with the most goals.

Here's how the program works:

1. Read the number of goals from the input.
2. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the number of goals scored by each team.
3. Read the name of the team that scored each goal and update the dictionary accordingly.
4. Find the team with the most goals using the `max` function.
5. Print the name of the winning team.

Example use case:

Input:
```
5
TEAM_A
TEAM_B
TEAM_A
TEAM_A
TEAM_B
```
Output:
```
TEAM_A
```
Note that this program assumes that the input is well-formed and that the description contains no more than two different teams, as stated in the problem.
