**Solution to Gift Exchange Problem**
=====================================

**Problem Statement**
--------------------

Given a list of integers representing the friend who gave a gift to each friend, find the friend who gave a gift to each friend.

**Code Solution**
----------------

```python
def find_gift_givers(n, gifts):
    """
    Find the friend who gave a gift to each friend.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of friends.
        gifts (list): A list of integers representing the friend who gave a gift to each friend.

    Returns:
        list: A list of integers representing the friend who gave a gift to each friend.
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the gift givers
    gift_givers = [0] * n

    # Iterate over the gifts list
    for i in range(n):
        # The friend who received the gift at index i is the friend at index gifts[i] - 1
        # So, the friend who gave the gift to friend i is the friend at index i
        gift_givers[gifts[i] - 1] = i + 1

    # Return the list of gift givers
    return gift_givers

# Read the input
n = int(input())
gifts = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Find the gift givers
gift_givers = find_gift_givers(n, gifts)

# Print the gift givers
print(' '.join(map(str, gift_givers)))
```

**Example Use Case**
-------------------

Input:
```
3
2 3 1
```
Output:
```
3 1 2
```
Explanation:
Friend 1 received a gift from friend 3.
Friend 2 received a gift from friend 1.
Friend 3 received a gift from friend 2.

**Explanation**
---------------

1. Read the input: Read the number of friends `n` and the list of gifts `gifts`.
2. Initialize an empty list `gift_givers` to store the friend who gave a gift to each friend.
3. Iterate over the `gifts` list. For each friend `i`, find the friend who gave a gift to friend `i` by finding the friend at index `gifts[i] - 1`.
4. Store the friend who gave the gift to friend `i` in the `gift_givers` list at index `gifts[i] - 1`.
5. Print the `gift_givers` list.

Note: This solution assumes that the input is valid and that each friend received exactly one gift.
