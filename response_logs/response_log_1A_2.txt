Certainly! I'll outline a solution to calculate the minimum number of square flagstones required to cover a rectangular theatre square. This will involve determining the number of flagstones needed to cover the length and width of the theatre square. Here is the implementation:

```python
import math

# Read input values
n, m, a = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the number of flagstones needed to cover the length and width
flagstones_length = math.ceil(n / a)
flagstones_width = math.ceil(m / a)

# Calculate the total number of flagstones needed
total_flagstones = flagstones_length * flagstones_width

# Print the result
print(total_flagstones)
```

### Explanation

*   The solution begins by reading the input values `n`, `m`, and `a` from the user, which represent the length, width, and size of the flagstones, respectively. These values are converted to integers using the `map` function in combination with `int`.
*   To determine the number of flagstones required to cover the length and width, the `math.ceil` function is utilized in conjunction with division to round up to the nearest whole number. This ensures that the theatre square is fully covered, even if the flagstones exceed its dimensions. The results are stored in `flagstones_length` and `flagstones_width`.
*   Finally, the total number of flagstones needed is calculated by multiplying `flagstones_length` and `flagstones_width`, and the result is printed to the console.
