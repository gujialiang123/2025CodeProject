**Solution**

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of times we can replace a given number with the sum of its digits until it becomes a single-digit number.

### Algorithm

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a simple iterative approach. We will continue to calculate the sum of the digits of the number until it becomes a single-digit number.

### Code

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    """Calculate the sum of digits of a given number."""
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in n)

def count_sum_operations(n):
    """Count the number of operations required to reduce a number to a single digit."""
    count = 0
    while len(n) > 1:
        n = str(sum_of_digits(n))
        count += 1
    return count

def main():
    n = input().strip()
    result = count_sum_operations(n)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. The `sum_of_digits` function calculates the sum of digits of a given number by iterating over each character (digit) in the string representation of the number, converting it to an integer, and summing them up.
2. The `count_sum_operations` function counts the number of operations required to reduce a number to a single digit. It does this by repeatedly calculating the sum of the digits of the number and updating the number until it becomes a single digit.
3. In the `main` function, we read the input number as a string, call the `count_sum_operations` function, and print the result.

### Example Use Cases

* Input: `16`
Output: `1`
Explanation: `16` becomes `1 + 6 = 7`, which is a single-digit number.
* Input: `942`
Output: `2`
Explanation: `942` becomes `9 + 4 + 2 = 15`, and then `15` becomes `1 + 5 = 6`, which is a single-digit number.

Note that this solution uses string manipulation to avoid issues with large numbers, as suggested in the problem hint.
