## Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize the properties of arithmetic sequences and the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. However, directly applying these might still lead to a solution that doesn't meet the O(1) time complexity requirement due to the large input size. Instead, recognizing the pattern of the series as an alternating series allows us to derive a more efficient approach.

The given series is an alternating series where each term increases linearly by 1 but alternates in sign:

1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ...

For an even `n`, the series can be paired as follows:

(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + ((n-1) - n)

Each pair sums to -1. For an odd `n`, we have one additional positive term at the end:

(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + ((n-2) - (n-1)) + n

This additional term is `n` when `n` is odd.

### Formula Derivation

- For even `n`, the number of pairs is `n/2`, so the sum is `-1 * (n/2)`.
- For odd `n`, we have `n/2` pairs (where `n/2` is rounded down, since `n` is odd) contributing `-1` each, and then the last term `n`, so the sum is `(-1) * ((n-1)/2) + n`.

### Simplification

Let's simplify these expressions:

- For even `n`: `-n/2`
- For odd `n`: `(-1) * ((n-1)/2) + n = -n/2 + 1/2 + n = n/2 + 1/2 = (n+1)/2`

However, observing the pattern more closely and considering the alternation of signs, we can directly derive a simpler and unified approach without needing to explicitly split into even and odd cases. The key insight is recognizing that each pair of consecutive terms in the sequence contributes a constant difference to the sum, allowing for a direct formulaic approach based on `n`.

### Unified Approach

The unified formula, taking into account the alternation of signs and the linear increase of terms, can be represented as follows:

Given `n`, the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence, considering the alternation, can actually be simplified into a formula based on the pattern of addition and subtraction.

However, considering the geometric sequence summation formula hint provided, let's directly apply a more suitable approach for this specific problem. The series can indeed be seen as a special case where the pattern of addition and subtraction creates pairs that contribute to the overall sum in a predictable manner.

For a large `n`, calculating this directly term by term is inefficient. Instead, recognizing the pattern of pairs and applying mathematical principles to derive a direct formula is essential. 

### Code Solution (Python)

```python
def calculate_f(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:  # n is even
        return -n // 2
    else:  # n is odd
        return (n + 1) // 2

# Read input
n = int(input())

# Calculate and print f(n)
result = calculate_f(n)
print(result)
```

### Explanation of Code

- The code defines a function `calculate_f(n)` that calculates `f(n)` based on whether `n` is even or odd.
- For even `n`, it returns `-n/2`.
- For odd `n`, it returns `(n+1)/2`, effectively calculating the sum of the series up to `n`.
- The input `n` is read from the user.
- The result of `f(n)` is calculated using the `calculate_f(n)` function and printed out.

This solution directly calculates `f(n)` in O(1) time, meeting the efficiency requirement for large inputs up to `10^15`.

**Solution: Calculating the Function f(n) using Geometric Sequence Summation Formula**

### Problem Analysis

The function `f(n)` is defined as an alternating series where each term's sign is determined by `(-1)^n` and its value is equal to `n`. The task is to calculate `f(n)` for a given integer `n` in an efficient manner.

### Solution Overview

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize the formula for the sum of a geometric series. However, since the series is alternating, we need to consider cases where `n` is odd and even separately to apply the formula correctly.

### Geometric Series Formula

The sum of the first `n` terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
\[S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}\]
where `a` is the first term, `r` is the common ratio, and `n` is the number of terms.

For our series, `a = -1` (the first term), and `r = -1` (since the series alternates).

### Calculating f(n)

To apply the geometric series sum formula to our problem, we recognize that our series can be seen as two separate series: one with positive terms and one with negative terms, both of which are geometric series with `r = -1`. However, directly applying the formula will not yield an efficient solution due to the nature of the problem.

Instead, notice that the series can be rearranged into pairs of consecutive terms that sum to 1:
```r
f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - ... + ((-1)^n)*n
```
can be grouped as:
```r
f(n) = (-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + ... + ((-1)^n)*n
```
Each pair sums to 1, except possibly the last term if `n` is odd.

### Efficient Calculation

1. **Count the pairs**: The number of complete pairs can be found by dividing `n` by 2 (integer division).
2. **Calculate the sum of complete pairs**: Each pair sums to 1, so the sum of all complete pairs is equal to the number of pairs.
3. **Handle the last term if `n` is odd**: If `n` is odd, there's an extra term at the end which is not part of a complete pair. This term's value is `(-1)^n * n`, but since `n` is odd, `(-1)^n = -1`, so this term is `-n`.

### Code Implementation

```python
def calculate_f_n(n):
    # If n is even, the sum of the series up to n is the sum of the pairs
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n // 2
    # If n is odd, the sum includes the negative of the last term
    else:
        return n // 2 - n

# Example usage
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer n: "))
print("f(n) =", calculate_f_n(n))
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) since we only perform a constant number of operations regardless of the input size `n`. This efficiency meets the requirement to avoid timing out for large inputs.

## Problem Analysis
The problem defines a function `f(n)` as the alternating sum of integers from 1 to `n`. We need to calculate `f(n)` for a given positive integer `n`.

## Solution Overview
To solve this problem in O(1) time complexity, we can use the formula for the sum of an alternating arithmetic series, which can be derived from the geometric sequence summation formula.

## Formula Derivation
The given series can be written as:
`f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + ... + (-1)^n*n`

We can pair consecutive terms:
`(-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + ... + ((-1)^(n-1)*(n-1) + (-1)^n*n)`

Each pair sums to 1:
`f(n) = 1 + 1 + ... + 1` (with `n/2` pairs if `n` is even)

If `n` is odd, the last term remains unpaired:
`f(n) = 1 + 1 + ... + 1 - n` (with `(n-1)/2` pairs)

## Formula
Let's derive the formula:
- If `n` is even, `f(n) = n/2`
- If `n` is odd, `f(n) = -(n+1)/2`

## Code Implementation
```python
def calculate_f(n):
    """
    Calculate f(n) for a given positive integer n.
    
    Args:
    n (int): A positive integer.
    
    Returns:
    int: The result of f(n).
    """
    if n % 2 == 0:  # n is even
        return n // 2
    else:  # n is odd
        return -(n + 1) // 2

# Read input
n = int(input())

# Calculate and print f(n)
result = calculate_f(n)
print(result)
```

## Example Use Cases
- Input: `1`
  Output: `-1`
- Input: `2`
  Output: `1`
- Input: `3`
  Output: `-2`
- Input: `4`
  Output: `2`
- Input: `10^15`
  Output: Calculated `f(n)` for the given `n`. 

This solution uses the derived formula to calculate `f(n)` in O(1) time complexity, avoiding the need for iterative summation and ensuring efficient computation for large inputs.
