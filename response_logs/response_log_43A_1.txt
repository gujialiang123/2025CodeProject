## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach where we count the number of goals scored by each team. The team with the most goals at the end of the match is the winner.

### Code

```python
def find_winner():
    # Read the number of goals
    n = int(input())

    # Initialize a dictionary to store the count of goals for each team
    teams = {}

    # Read the name of each team that scored a goal
    for _ in range(n):
        team = input()

        # Increment the count of goals for the current team
        if team in teams:
            teams[team] += 1
        else:
            teams[team] = 1

    # Find the team with the most goals
    winner = max(teams, key=teams.get)

    return winner

# Print the winner
print(find_winner())
```

### Explanation

1. Read the number of goals `n` from the input.
2. Initialize an empty dictionary `teams` to store the count of goals for each team.
3. Read the name of each team that scored a goal and increment the count of goals for that team in the `teams` dictionary.
4. Find the team with the most goals by using the `max` function with the `key` argument set to `teams.get`.
5. Print the winning team.

### Example Use Case

Input:
```
5
A
B
A
A
B
```

Output:
```
A
```

This solution assumes that the input is well-formed and that the match did not end in a tie, as stated in the problem description. It has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of goals, and a space complexity of O(k) where k is the number of unique teams.

Here is a complete solution to the problem:

```python
# Read the number of goals
n = int(input())

# Initialize a dictionary to store the goal counts
goal_counts = {}

# Read each goal and update the goal counts
for _ in range(n):
    team = input()
    if team in goal_counts:
        goal_counts[team] += 1
    else:
        goal_counts[team] = 1

# Find the team with the most goals
winning_team = max(goal_counts, key=goal_counts.get)

# Print the winning team
print(winning_team)
```

Here's an explanation of how the solution works:

1. First, we read the number of goals `n` from the input.
2. We initialize a dictionary `goal_counts` to store the number of goals scored by each team. The team names will be the keys, and the values will be the goal counts.
3. We then read each goal and update the `goal_counts` dictionary accordingly. If the team is already in the dictionary, we increment their goal count. If not, we add the team to the dictionary with a goal count of 1.
4. After reading all the goals, we use the `max` function with the `key` argument set to `goal_counts.get` to find the team with the most goals. This function returns the key (team name) with the maximum value (goal count).
5. Finally, we print the winning team.

This solution works because the problem guarantees that the match does not end in a tie, so there will always be a team with more goals than the others. Also, the problem guarantees that there are no more than two different teams, so we don't need to worry about handling multiple teams with the same maximum goal count.
