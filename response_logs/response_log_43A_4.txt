**Solution: Determine the Winning Team in a Football Match**

**Problem Statement:**
Given a description of a football match, determine the winning team by counting the number of goals scored by each team.

**Constraints:**

* The match description consists of `n` lines, where `1 <= n <= 100`.
* Each line represents a goal and contains the name of the team that scored it.
* Team names are non-empty strings consisting of uppercase Latin letters, with a maximum length of 10 characters.
* The match did not end in a tie, and there are no more than two different teams in the description.

**Solution:**

### GoalCounter Class

```python
class GoalCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.team_goals = {}

    def add_goal(self, team_name):
        if team_name in self.team_goals:
            self.team_goals[team_name] += 1
        else:
            self.team_goals[team_name] = 1

    def get_winning_team(self):
        winning_team = max(self.team_goals, key=self.team_goals.get)
        return winning_team


def main():
    num_goals = int(input())

    goal_counter = GoalCounter()
    for _ in range(num_goals):
        team_name = input().strip()
        goal_counter.add_goal(team_name)

    winning_team = goal_counter.get_winning_team()
    print(winning_team)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. We define a `GoalCounter` class to keep track of the number of goals scored by each team.
2. The `add_goal` method updates the goal count for a team. If the team is not already in the `team_goals` dictionary, it is added with a count of 1.
3. The `get_winning_team` method determines the team with the most goals by finding the key with the maximum value in the `team_goals` dictionary.
4. In the `main` function, we read the number of goals, create a `GoalCounter` object, and iterate through each goal, adding it to the counter.
5. Finally, we retrieve the winning team using the `get_winning_team` method and print it.

### Example Usage:

Input:
```
5
TEAM_A
TEAM_B
TEAM_A
TEAM_A
TEAM_B
```
Output:
```
TEAM_A
```
