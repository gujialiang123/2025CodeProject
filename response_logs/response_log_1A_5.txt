**Theatre Square Problem Solution**

### Problem Overview

The problem requires calculating the minimum number of square granite flagstones needed to cover a rectangular theatre square of size `n` x `m` meters. Each flagstone has a size of `a` x `a` meters.

### Solution

To find the minimum number of flagstones required, we need to calculate the area of the theatre square and divide it by the area of a single flagstone. However, since we can't break the flagstones and must cover the entire square, we need to consider the ceiling of the division of the square's dimensions by the flagstone's size.

#### Code Solution

```python
import math

def calculate_flagstones(n, m, a):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of flagstones needed to cover the theatre square.

    Args:
        n (int): Length of the theatre square in meters.
        m (int): Width of the theatre square in meters.
        a (int): Size of the flagstone in meters.

    Returns:
        int: Minimum number of flagstones needed.
    """
    # Calculate the number of flagstones needed to cover the length and width of the square
    flagstones_length = math.ceil(n / a)
    flagstones_width = math.ceil(m / a)

    # Calculate the total number of flagstones needed
    total_flagstones = flagstones_length * flagstones_width

    return total_flagstones

# Read input values
n, m, a = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the minimum number of flagstones
print(calculate_flagstones(n, m, a))
```

### Example Use Cases

* Input: `6 9 4`
Output: `6`
* Input: `10 15 3`
Output: `25`
* Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
Output: `1000000000000000000`

### Explanation

1. Read the input values `n`, `m`, and `a` from the user.
2. Calculate the number of flagstones needed to cover the length and width of the square by dividing the dimensions by the flagstone size and taking the ceiling of the result.
3. Multiply the number of flagstones needed for the length and width to get the total number of flagstones required.
4. Print the total number of flagstones needed.

This solution ensures that the entire theatre square is covered with the minimum number of flagstones, considering that the flagstones cannot be broken and must be parallel to the sides of the square.
