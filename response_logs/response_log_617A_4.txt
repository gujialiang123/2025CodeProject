**Minimum Steps for Elephant to Reach Friend's House**
=====================================================

### Problem Description

The elephant needs to reach its friend's house located at point x (x > 0) from its own house at point 0. The elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward in one step. We need to determine the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to reach its friend's house.

### Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a simple greedy approach. The idea is to use the largest possible steps (5) as much as possible and then use the remaining steps (1, 2, 3, or 4) to cover the remaining distance.

#### Code Solution

```python
def min_steps(x):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of steps for the elephant to reach its friend's house.

    Args:
    x (int): The coordinate of the friend's house.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of steps required.
    """
    # Calculate the number of steps of 5
    steps_5 = x // 5
    
    # Calculate the remaining distance
    remaining_distance = x % 5
    
    # Calculate the number of steps for the remaining distance
    if remaining_distance == 0:
        return steps_5
    elif remaining_distance <= 3:
        return steps_5 + 1
    else:
        return steps_5 + 2

# Example usage
x = int(input())
print(min_steps(x))
```

### Explanation

The code first calculates the number of steps of 5 using integer division (`x // 5`). It then calculates the remaining distance using the modulo operator (`x % 5`).

If the remaining distance is 0, it means the elephant can reach its friend's house exactly using steps of 5, so it returns the number of steps of 5.

If the remaining distance is 1, 2, or 3, it means the elephant can cover the remaining distance in 1 step, so it returns the number of steps of 5 plus 1.

If the remaining distance is 4, it means the elephant can cover the remaining distance in 2 steps (4 = 4 or 3 + 1), so it returns the number of steps of 5 plus 2.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it only involves a constant number of operations, regardless of the input size.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input and the result.

**Elephant and Friend Houses Problem Solution**

### Problem Description
The elephant's house is located at point 0 and his friend's house is located at point x (x > 0) of the coordinate line. The elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward in one step. We need to determine the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get to his friend's house.

### Solution
To solve this problem, we can use a simple mathematical approach based on the division of the distance by the maximum step size.

#### Code Solution (Python)
```python
def min_steps_to_friend_house(x):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house.

    Args:
    x (int): The coordinate of the friend's house.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of steps required.
    """
    return (x + 4) // 5

# Example usage
x = int(input())  # Read the input coordinate
min_steps = min_steps_to_friend_house(x)
print(min_steps)  # Print the minimum number of steps
```

### Explanation
The idea behind the solution is to divide the distance `x` by the maximum step size, which is 5. However, since we need to handle cases where `x` is not a multiple of 5, we add 4 to `x` before performing the division. This ensures that we round up to the nearest whole number, which represents the minimum number of steps required.

The `//` operator in Python performs integer division, which discards the fractional part and returns the integer part. By using `(x + 4) // 5`, we effectively calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only perform a constant number of operations to calculate the minimum number of steps.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the input and output values.
