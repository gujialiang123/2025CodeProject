## Solution
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. However, in this case, we don't have a straightforward geometric sequence because of the term multiplication with n. But we can notice a pattern when grouping terms:

f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + ... + (-1)^n*n

If we group them:

f(n) = (-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + ... + ((-1)^(n-1)*(n-1) + (-1)^n*n)

Each pair sums to 1:

f(n) = 1 + 1 + ... + 1 + ((-1)^n*n - (-1)^(n-1)*(n-1))

If n is even, the last two terms of the sequence before n would be (-n+1) and n, which would sum to 1 as well:

f(n) = 1 + 1 + ... + 1

The number of pairs (1's) can be found by dividing n by 2.

If n is odd, the last term would be -n, so the sum of all pairs except the last one would still be the number of pairs (n-1)/2, but then we add the last term which is (-1)^n*n = -n.

Therefore, the formula for f(n) can be simplified as follows:

* For even n: f(n) = n/2
* For odd n: f(n) = -(n+1)/2

We can express this using a simple mathematical formula:

f(n) = ((-1)^n + 1) * n / 2 / 2 + ((-1)^n - 1) * -n / 2 / 2 

Or simplified:

f(n) = ((-1)^n + 1) * n / 4 + ((-1)^n - 1) * -n / 4 
= n * ((-1)^n + 1 - (-1)^n + 1) / 4 
= n * (2 - 2 * (-1)^n) / 4 
= n * (1 - (-1)^n) / 2 

Or in another form that is commonly seen:
f(n) = (n + 1)/2 if n is even after removing the minus sign in the sequence (i.e., for n = 4k) and f(n) = -n/2 if n is odd after removing the minus sign in the sequence (i.e., for n = 4k + 1) and the above equations directly calculate the summation.


### Python Code

```python
def calculate_fn(n):
    """
    Calculate f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + .. + (-1)^n*n.

    Args:
        n (int): The input number.

    Returns:
        int: The result of f(n).
    """
    if n % 2 == 0:  # n is even
        return n // 2
    else:  # n is odd
        return -(n + 1) // 2

# Test the function
n = int(input())
print(calculate_fn(n))
```

### Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function `calculate_fn(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the result of the function f(n). It checks whether `n` is even or odd and calculates the result accordingly. If `n` is even, it returns `n // 2`; otherwise, it returns `-(n + 1) // 2`. The `//` operator is used for integer division to ensure the result is an integer. The code then reads an integer `n` from the input, calculates f(n) using the `calculate_fn(n)` function, and prints the result.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means the running time is constant and does not depend on the size of the input `n`. This is because the solution only involves a constant number of operations, regardless of the value of `n`. This makes it efficient for large inputs.
