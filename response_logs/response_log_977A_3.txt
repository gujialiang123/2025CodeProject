### Problem Solution: Tanya's Subtraction Algorithm

#### Problem Description
Tanya subtracts one from a number by a custom algorithm:
- If the last digit is non-zero, she decreases the number by one.
- If the last digit is zero, she divides the number by 10 (removes the last digit).
We are given an integer `n` and the number of subtractions `k`. The task is to print the result after all `k` subtractions.

#### Solution

We will implement Tanya's subtraction algorithm in Python. The algorithm will be as follows:
- Convert the number to a string to easily access the last digit.
- For each subtraction, check the last digit of the number.
  - If it's non-zero, decrease the number by one.
  - If it's zero, remove the last digit (divide by 10).
- Repeat the subtraction process `k` times.

```python
def tanyas_subtraction(n, k):
    """
    Simulates Tanya's subtraction algorithm.

    Args:
        n (int): The initial number.
        k (int): The number of subtractions.

    Returns:
        int: The result after k subtractions.
    """
    # Convert the number to a string for easy manipulation
    num_str = str(n)

    # Perform k subtractions
    for _ in range(k):
        # Check the last digit
        if num_str[-1] != '0':
            # Decrease the number by one
            num_str = str(int(num_str) - 1)
        else:
            # Remove the last digit (divide by 10)
            num_str = num_str[:-1]

    # Convert the result back to an integer and return
    return int(num_str)

# Example usage
n, k = map(int, input().split())
result = tanyas_subtraction(n, k)
print(result)
```

#### Explanation
- The function `tanyas_subtraction` takes two arguments: `n` and `k`, representing the initial number and the number of subtractions, respectively.
- The function converts `n` to a string `num_str` for easy manipulation of digits.
- It then enters a loop that iterates `k` times, performing the subtraction algorithm in each iteration.
- If the last digit of `num_str` is not '0', it converts `num_str` back to an integer, decrements it by 1, and then converts it back to a string.
- If the last digit is '0', it removes the last character (digit) from `num_str`, effectively dividing the number by 10.
- After `k` subtractions, it converts `num_str` back to an integer and returns the result.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(k * m), where k is the number of subtractions and m is the average number of digits in the number during the subtraction process. However, since k is guaranteed to be at most 50 and the operations within the loop are constant time, the solution is efficient for the given constraints.
