**Problem Solution: Gift Exchangers**

### Problem Analysis

The problem describes a scenario where Petya has invited `n` friends to a party, and each friend gives a gift to another friend. Petya wants to determine for each friend `i` the number of the friend who has given them a gift.

### Algorithm

To solve this problem, we can use a simple indexing approach. We are given an array `p` of size `n`, where `p[i]` represents the friend who received the gift from friend `i`. Since each friend receives exactly one gift, we can iterate through the array `p` and construct the reverse mapping, i.e., determine who gave the gift to each friend.

### Solution

Here is a C++ solution for the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<int> p(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> p[i];
    }

    std::vector<int> result(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result[p[i] - 1] = i + 1; // 1-indexed output
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cout << result[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. Read the input `n`, representing the number of friends.
2. Read the array `p` of size `n`, where `p[i]` represents the friend who received the gift from friend `i`.
3. Create an empty vector `result` of size `n` to store the friend who gave the gift to each friend.
4. Iterate through the array `p`. For each friend `i`, set `result[p[i] - 1]` to `i + 1`, since `p[i]` is the friend who received the gift, and `i + 1` is the friend who gave the gift (1-indexed).
5. Print the `result` vector to get the desired output.

### Example Use Cases

* Input:
  ```
5
2 1 4 3 5
```

  Output:
  ```
2 1 5 4 3
```

* Input:
  ```
3
1 3 2
```

  Output:
  ```
1 3 2
```

Note: The code assumes 1-indexed input and output, as specified in the problem statement.

**Gift Exchange Problem Solution**
=====================================

**Problem Statement**
--------------------

Petya wants to know for each friend `i` the number of a friend who has given a gift to friend number `i`. We are given a list of friend numbers who gave gifts to each other.

**Solution Approach**
-------------------

To solve this problem, we can use a simple array-based approach. We will create an array where the index represents the friend number and the value at that index represents the friend number who gave the gift to that friend.

**Code Solution**
----------------

```python
def find_gift_givers(n, p):
    """
    Find the friend number who gave a gift to each friend.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of friends.
        p (list): A list where the i-th element is the friend number who gave a gift to friend number i.

    Returns:
        list: A list where the i-th element is the friend number who gave a gift to friend number i.
    """
    # Create a list to store the friend number who gave a gift to each friend
    gift_givers = [0] * n

    # Iterate over the list of friend numbers who gave gifts
    for i in range(n):
        # The friend number who gave a gift to friend number i is p[i]
        gift_givers[p[i] - 1] = i + 1

    return gift_givers


# Example usage
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))

gift_givers = find_gift_givers(n, p)
print(*gift_givers)
```

**Explanation**
--------------

1. The `find_gift_givers` function takes two inputs: `n`, the number of friends, and `p`, a list where the i-th element is the friend number who gave a gift to friend number i.
2. We create a list `gift_givers` of length `n` to store the friend number who gave a gift to each friend.
3. We iterate over the list `p` and for each friend number `i`, we set the value at index `p[i] - 1` in the `gift_givers` list to `i + 1`. This is because array indices start from 0, but friend numbers start from 1.
4. Finally, we return the `gift_givers` list.

**Example Use Case**
--------------------

Input:
```
3
2 3 1
```
Output:
```
3 1 2
```
In this example, friend number 3 gave a gift to friend number 1, friend number 1 gave a gift to friend number 2, and friend number 2 gave a gift to friend number 3.
