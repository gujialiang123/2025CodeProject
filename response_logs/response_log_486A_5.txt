**Solution: Calculating the Function f(n)**

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to calculate the function `f(n)` for a given positive integer `n`, where `f(n)` is defined as:

`f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + .. + (-1)^n * n`

We can observe that this is an alternating series, where each term is of the form `(-1)^k * k`.

### Geometric Sequence Summation Formula

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the geometric sequence summation formula. However, this formula cannot be applied directly to the given series. Instead, we can use the following approach:

Let's consider two separate series:

1. The series of positive terms: `1 + 3 + 5 + ...`
2. The series of negative terms: `-1 - 2 - 4 - 6 - ...`

We can then calculate the sum of each series separately and combine the results.

### Calculating the Sum of the Series

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of each series. However, this approach would not be efficient for large values of `n`.

A more efficient approach is to use the following formulas:

Let `m` be the number of terms in the series of positive terms. Then `m = (n + 1) / 2` (integer division).

The sum of the series of positive terms is: `S_positive = (m * (m + 1)) / 2`

The sum of the series of negative terms is: `S_negative = -(m * (m - 1)) / 2 - ((n % 2) == 0)`

If `n` is odd, then we multiply the `m`-th term by `-1` and add it to `S_negative`.

Finally, we return `S_positive + S_negative` as the result.

### Implementation

Here is a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def calculate_f(n):
    """
    Calculate the function f(n) for a given positive integer n.

    Args:
        n (int): A positive integer.

    Returns:
        int: The value of f(n).
    """
    m = (n + 1) // 2
    S_positive = (m * (m + 1)) // 2
    S_negative = -(m * (m - 1)) // 2
    if (n % 2) == 0:
        return S_negative - S_positive
    else:
        return S_positive - S_negative

# Read the input
n = int(input())

# Calculate and print the result
result = calculate_f(n)
print(result)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), making it efficient for large values of `n`.

## Problem Analysis

The problem involves calculating the value of a function f(n) defined as the sum of alternating positive and negative integers up to n. The function can be written as:

f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + ... + (-1)^n*n

The task is to calculate f(n) for a given integer n.

## Solution Overview

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize the formula for the sum of a geometric sequence. By observing the pattern in the given series, we can rewrite it as the sum of two separate series:

1. The sum of the positive terms: 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + (2*(n/2)) if n is even, or 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + ((n-1)/2)*2 if n is odd.
2. The sum of the negative terms: -1 - 3 - 5 - ... - ((n-1)/2)*2 if n is odd, or -1 - 3 - 5 - ... - (n/2)*2 if n is even.

We will handle the cases where n is odd and even separately.

## Solution

### Algorithm

1. **Check if n is odd or even**.
2. **Calculate the sum of the positive terms**: If n is even, use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2. If n is odd, use the same formula but with the last term being ((n-1)/2)*2.
3. **Calculate the sum of the negative terms**: If n is odd, use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2. If n is even, use the same formula but with the last term being (n/2)*2.
4. **Return the difference between the sum of the positive and negative terms**.

### Code

```python
def calculate_f(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the value of f(n) defined as the sum of alternating positive and negative integers up to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The input integer.

    Returns:
        int: The calculated value of f(n).
    """
    if n % 2 == 0:  # n is even
        positive_terms = (n // 2) * (2 + n) // 2
        negative_terms = (n // 2) * (-1 - (n - 1)) // 2
    else:  # n is odd
        positive_terms = ((n + 1) // 2) * (2 + n) // 2
        negative_terms = ((n + 1) // 2) * (-1 - n) // 2
    
    return positive_terms + negative_terms

n = int(input())
result = calculate_f(n)
print(result)
```

However, this can be simplified using the direct mathematical solution:
If we calculate `f(n)` for `n` being even and odd and derive a pattern from it, we get the following direct solution:

`f(n) = (-1)^n * (n+1)/2 if n % 4 == 0` for even `n`
`f(n) = -((n+1)/2) if n % 4 == 1` for odd `n`
`f(n) = (-1)^n * (n+1)/2 if n % 4 == 2` for even `n`
`f(n) = ((n+1)/2) if n % 4 == 3` for odd `n`
Based on these rules, we simplify this formula to a single step:
We will consider `f(n) = - (n+1)/2 if n % 4 == 1 or n % 4 == 2`, 
and `f(n) = (n+1)/2 if n % 4 == 0 or n % 4 == 3`

The following Python code can be used to calculate `f(n)`:

```python
def f(n):
    if (n % 4 == 1) or (n % 4 == 2):
        return -((n+1)//2)
    return (n+1)//2
```


And finally, here is the final code block:

```python
def calculate_f(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the value of f(n) defined as the sum of alternating positive and negative integers up to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The input integer.

    Returns:
        int: The calculated value of f(n).
    """
    if (n % 4 == 1) or (n % 4 == 2):
        return -(n + 1) // 2
    return (n + 1) // 2

n = int(input())
result = calculate_f(n)
print(result)
```
This Python code reads an integer `n` from the input, calculates `f(n)` using the simplified formula, and prints the result.

## Example Use Cases

For example, if the input is `5`, the output will be `3`, because `f(5) = -1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 = -3`. 

If the input is `4`, the output will be `2`, because `f(4) = -1 + 2 - 3 + 4 = 2`. 

Note: You should replace the input() call in the final code block with your own test case, if needed.

After you execute the function with your input, provide your response in the required format.

Let's run the final code with the sample inputs to verify the results:

If we use n = 5:
```
n = 5
result = calculate_f(n)
print(result)
```
This code will output `-3`.

If we use n = 4:
```python
n = 4
result = calculate_f(n)
print(result)
```
This code will output `2`.

## Problem Analysis

We are given a function `f(n)` defined as the sum of the alternating series: `-1 + 2 - 3 + ... + (-1)^n * n`. Our task is to calculate `f(n)` for a given positive integer `n`.

## Solution Strategy

The given series is an example of an alternating series, where the sign of each term alternates between positive and negative. To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize the formula for the sum of an alternating series.

Let's analyze the pattern of the series:
- The sum of the first two terms is `-1 + 2 = 1`.
- The sum of the first three terms is `-1 + 2 - 3 = -2`.
- The sum of the first four terms is `-1 + 2 - 3 + 4 = 2`.

Notice that the sum of the series alternates between `-n/2` when `n` is even and `-(n+1)/2 + n = (n-1)/2` when `n` is odd.

However, a more elegant solution can be derived using the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the concept of alternating series.

## Solution

The formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n*(n+1)/2`.

For an even `n`, we can pair up the terms as follows: `(-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + ... + (-(n-1) + n)`. Each pair sums up to `1`. Since there are `n/2` pairs, the total sum is `n/2`.

For an odd `n`, we can similarly pair up the terms, but there will be one unpaired term at the end: `(-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + ... + (-(n-2) + (n-1)) + (-n)`. Each pair sums up to `1`. Since there are `(n-1)/2` pairs, the total sum of the pairs is `(n-1)/2`, and then we subtract the last unpaired term `n`, leading to the formula `-(n+1)/2 + n = (n-1)/2`.

However, considering the original series and the properties of arithmetic sequences, a more direct and efficient approach can be applied using the summation formula for an arithmetic series with alternating signs. Since the common difference and the sign pattern are known, the series sum can be derived based on these properties.

Given the pattern and the need for an efficient computation, let's simplify the problem using the arithmetic series sum formula and consider the properties of the alternating series.

Here is the code in Python that calculates `f(n)`:

```python
def f(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the alternating series: -1 + 2 - 3 + ... + (-1)^n * n.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of terms in the series.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the alternating series.
    """
    if n % 2 == 0:
        # When n is even, the sum can be calculated using the formula n/2
        return -n // 2
    else:
        # When n is odd, the sum can be calculated using the formula (n + 1) / 2
        return (n + 1) // 2

# Read input
n = int(input())

# Calculate f(n)
result = f(n)

# Print result
print(result)
```

This code directly calculates the sum based on whether `n` is even or odd, providing an efficient solution without needing to iterate over each term in the series.

You can test this code with various inputs for `n` to see how it calculates `f(n)`. This solution avoids timing out for large inputs because it calculates the result in constant time, `O(1)`.

**Solution**
===============

The problem defines a function `f(n)` as the sum of the first `n` integers with alternating signs. We can solve this problem by recognizing that it's a sum of an arithmetic series with alternating signs. However, a more efficient approach is to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

Let's start by examining the given series:
```math
f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + ... + (-1)^n * n
```
We can pair consecutive terms to see a pattern:
```math
(-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + ... + (-(n-1) + n)  # if n is even
```
or
```math
(-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + ... + (-n)  # if n is odd
```
Each pair sums to `1`.

**Code Solution**
------------------

We'll use the following insights to write our code:

*   If `n` is even, the last pair will have no remaining term, so we can calculate the sum by multiplying the number of pairs by `1`.
*   If `n` is odd, we need to consider the last term, which is `-n`.

Here's the Python code to calculate `f(n)`:

```python
def calculate_f(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + .. + (-1)^n * n

    Args:
    n (int): A positive integer.

    Returns:
    int: The result of f(n).
    """

    # Calculate the number of pairs (each pair sums to 1)
    pairs = n // 2

    # If n is even, the sum is the number of pairs
    if n % 2 == 0:
        result = pairs
    # If n is odd, subtract the last term (which is -n) from the sum of pairs
    else:
        result = pairs - n

    return result


# Read input
n = int(input())

# Calculate and print f(n)
result = calculate_f(n)
print(result)

```

**Explanation**
--------------

Our solution uses a simple and efficient approach by recognizing the pattern of pairs in the given series. By calculating the number of pairs and considering the last term (if `n` is odd), we can determine `f(n)` in constant time complexity (`O(1)`), avoiding the need for iteration or recursion.

The code includes clear documentation and follows standard professional guidelines. It reads the input `n`, calculates `f(n)` using the `calculate_f` function, and prints the result.

**Solution: Calculating f(n) in O(1) Time Complexity**

The function f(n) can be calculated using the geometric sequence summation formula. We can observe that the given sequence is a geometric sequence with first term -1 and common ratio -1.

However, to calculate the sum of this sequence, we can pair every two consecutive terms. 

Let's pair the terms:

(-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) + ... + ((-1)^n * n)

Each pair sums to 1, so we have (n/2) pairs, each summing to 1, if n is even. If n is odd, there will be one extra term.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

### Step 1: Check if n is even or odd

If n is even, the number of pairs will be n/2. If n is odd, there will be (n-1)/2 pairs and the last term will be (-1)^n * n.

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of pairs

If n is even, the sum will be (n/2). If n is odd, the sum will be (n-1)/2 + (-1)^n * n.

Now, let's implement this logic in code.

### Code Implementation

```python
def calculate_f_n(n):
    """
    Calculate f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + ... + (-1)^n * n in O(1) time complexity.
    
    Args:
    n (int): A positive integer.
    
    Returns:
    int: The value of f(n).
    """
    
    # Check if n is even or odd
    if n % 2 == 0:
        # If n is even, the sum will be (n/2)
        return n // 2
    else:
        # If n is odd, the sum will be (n-1)/2 + (-1)^n * n
        # Since (-1)^n * n will be -n (because n is odd), 
        # we can simplify the formula to (n-1)/2 - n = - (n+1)/2
        return - (n + 1) // 2

# Read input
n = int(input())

# Calculate and print f(n)
print(calculate_f_n(n))
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), as we are performing a constant number of operations regardless of the input size. This is because we are using the geometric sequence summation formula to calculate the sum directly, without iterating over the sequence.

### Example Use Cases

* For n = 1, f(1) = -1
* For n = 2, f(2) = -1 + 2 = 1
* For n = 3, f(3) = -1 + 2 - 3 = -2
* For n = 100, f(100) = 50

This solution efficiently calculates f(n) for a given positive integer n, leveraging the geometric sequence summation formula to achieve a time complexity of O(1).
