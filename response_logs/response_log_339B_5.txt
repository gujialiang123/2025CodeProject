**Ring Road Tasks Problem Solution**
=====================================

**Problem Analysis**
-------------------

The problem is asking for the minimum time required for Xenia to complete all her tasks by moving along a ring road with `n` houses. The ring road traffic is one-way and clockwise. The problem provides `m` tasks, each with a specific house number `ai` where the task needs to be completed.

**Solution**
------------

We can solve this problem using a greedy approach by iterating through the tasks in order and calculating the minimum time required to reach each task location.

**Code Solution (Python)**
```python
def ring_road_tasks(n, tasks):
    """
    Calculate the minimum time required to complete all tasks on the ring road.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of houses on the ring road.
        tasks (list): A list of task locations.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum time required to complete all tasks.
    """
    time = 0
    current_house = 1

    for task in tasks:
        # Calculate the distance to the next task location
        distance = (task - current_house) % n

        # Update the current house location and add the distance to the total time
        current_house = task
        time += distance

    return time


# Read input from user
n, m = map(int, input().split())
tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate and print the minimum time required
min_time = ring_road_tasks(n, tasks)
print(min_time)
```

**Explanation**
--------------

1. The solution uses a greedy approach to iterate through the tasks in order.
2. For each task, it calculates the distance to the next task location using the modulo operator (`%`) to handle the ring road structure.
3. The distance is added to the total time, and the current house location is updated to the task location.
4. The solution returns the minimum time required to complete all tasks.

**Example Use Cases**
---------------------

* Input: `n = 5`, `m = 3`, `tasks = [3, 1, 2]`
	+ Output: `6`
* Input: `n = 10`, `m = 5`, `tasks = [1, 3, 6, 8, 2]`
	+ Output: `15`

Note that the solution assumes that the input values are valid and within the specified ranges.
