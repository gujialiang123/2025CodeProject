Here is a complete solution to the problem:

### Solution
We will iterate through each line in the description and keep track of the number of goals scored by each team. The team with the most goals at the end is the winner.

### Code
```python
def get_winner(n, lines):
    """Get the winner of the match."""
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the number of goals scored by each team
    goals = {}

    # Iterate through each line in the description
    for line in lines:
        # If the team is not in the dictionary, add it with 1 goal
        if line not in goals:
            goals[line] = 1
        # If the team is already in the dictionary, increment its goals by 1
        else:
            goals[line] += 1

    # Find the team with the most goals
    winner = max(goals, key=goals.get)

    return winner

def main():
    # Get the number of lines in the description
    n = int(input())

    # Get the description lines
    lines = [input() for _ in range(n)]

    # Get the winner
    winner = get_winner(n, lines)

    # Print the winner
    print(winner)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. We define a function `get_winner(n, lines)` that takes the number of lines `n` and the description lines `lines` as input and returns the winner of the match.
2. We initialize an empty dictionary `goals` to store the number of goals scored by each team.
3. We iterate through each line in the description and update the `goals` dictionary accordingly.
4. We find the team with the most goals using the `max` function with the `key` argument set to `goals.get`.
5. We define a `main` function that gets the number of lines and description lines from the input, calls the `get_winner` function, and prints the winner.
6. We use the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly.

### Example Usage
Input:
```
3
TeamA
TeamB
TeamA
```
Output:
```
TeamA
```
