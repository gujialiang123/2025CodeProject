**Candle Illumination Problem Solution**

### Problem Statement
Given a certain number of candles `a` and the ability to recycle `b` used candles into a new one, find the maximum number of hours the candles can illuminate the room.

### Solution
We can model this problem using a simple mathematical approach. The idea is to calculate the total number of hours the candles can burn and then add the additional hours gained from recycling the used candles.

#### Code Solution
```python
def max_illumination_hours(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the maximum number of hours the candles can illuminate the room.

    Args:
    a (int): The initial number of candles.
    b (int): The number of used candles required to recycle a new one.

    Returns:
    int: The maximum number of hours the candles can illuminate the room.
    """
    hours = a
    used_candles = a

    while used_candles >= b:
        new_candles = used_candles // b
        hours += new_candles
        used_candles = new_candles + (used_candles % b)

    return hours

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    max_hours = max_illumination_hours(a, b)
    print(max_hours)
```
### Explanation
The `max_illumination_hours` function takes two arguments: `a` (the initial number of candles) and `b` (the number of used candles required to recycle a new one).

The function first calculates the initial number of hours the candles can burn (`hours = a`). It also keeps track of the number of used candles (`used_candles = a`).

The function then enters a loop, where it calculates the number of new candles that can be recycled from the used candles (`new_candles = used_candles // b`). The total number of hours is increased by the number of new candles (`hours += new_candles`). The number of used candles is updated to be the number of new candles plus the remaining used candles that were not recycled (`used_candles = new_candles + (used_candles % b)`).

The loop continues until there are less than `b` used candles, at which point the function returns the total number of hours.

### Example Use Case
For example, if `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the function will calculate the maximum number of hours as follows:

1. Initial hours: 5
2. Initial used candles: 5
3. First iteration:
	* New candles: 5 // 3 = 1
	* Total hours: 5 + 1 = 6
	* Used candles: 1 + (5 % 3) = 1 + 2 = 3
4. Second iteration:
	* New candles: 3 // 3 = 1
	* Total hours: 6 + 1 = 7
	* Used candles: 1 + (3 % 3) = 1 + 0 = 1
5. Since there are less than 3 used candles, the function returns the total number of hours: 7

Therefore, the output of the program will be `7`, indicating that the candles can illuminate the room for a maximum of 7 hours.
