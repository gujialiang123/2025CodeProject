### Problem Overview

The problem requires us to determine the winning team of the Berland 1910 Football Championship finals based on a description of the match process. The description consists of `n` lines, each describing a goal scored by a team.

### Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we will:

1. Read the number of lines (`n`) in the description.
2. Initialize a dictionary to store the score of each team.
3. Iterate over each line in the description, incrementing the score of the corresponding team.
4. Determine the winning team by finding the team with the highest score.

### Code Solution

```python
def find_winning_team(n, teams):
    """
    Determine the winning team based on the match description.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of lines in the description.
        teams (list): A list of team names, where each team name corresponds to a goal.

    Returns:
        str: The name of the winning team.
    """
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the score of each team
    scores = {}

    # Iterate over each team in the description
    for team in teams:
        # Increment the score of the corresponding team
        if team in scores:
            scores[team] += 1
        else:
            scores[team] = 1

    # Determine the winning team by finding the team with the highest score
    winning_team = max(scores, key=scores.get)

    return winning_team

def main():
    # Read the number of lines in the description
    n = int(input())

    # Read the team names for each goal
    teams = [input() for _ in range(n)]

    # Find the winning team
    winning_team = find_winning_team(n, teams)

    # Print the name of the winning team
    print(winning_team)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Example Usage

To use this solution, simply compile and run the code. The program will prompt you to input the number of lines in the description, followed by each team name for each goal. The program will then output the name of the winning team.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
TeamA
TeamB
TeamA
```
The program will output:
```
TeamA
```
Indicating that `TeamA` is the winning team.
