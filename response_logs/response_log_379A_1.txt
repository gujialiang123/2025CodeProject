**Candle Illumination Problem Solution**
=====================================================

### Problem Description

Vasily has a certain number of candles and a way to recycle them. Each candle burns for an hour before going out. By collecting `b` burnt-out candles, Vasily can create a new candle that can be used just like any other new candle. We need to find the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room lit using his initial candles and the recycling process.

### Solution

The problem can be solved using a simple iterative approach. We start with the initial number of candles and calculate the number of hours they can burn. After each hour, we add the number of candles that can be recycled to the total number of candles. We repeat this process until there are not enough candles to recycle.

#### Code
```python
def candle_illumination(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room lit.

    Args:
    a (int): The initial number of candles.
    b (int): The number of burnt-out candles required to create a new candle.

    Returns:
    int: The maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room lit.
    """
    hours = 0
    candles = a

    while candles > 0:
        # Calculate the number of hours the current candles can burn
        burn_hours = min(candles, 1)
        hours += burn_hours

        # Update the number of candles
        candles -= burn_hours

        # Calculate the number of new candles that can be created
        new_candles = candles // b

        # Update the number of candles
        candles += new_candles

        # Remove the candles that were used to create new candles
        candles -= new_candles * b

    return hours


# Example usage
a, b = map(int, input().split())
result = candle_illumination(a, b)
print(result)
```

### Explanation

1. The `candle_illumination` function takes two arguments: `a` (the initial number of candles) and `b` (the number of burnt-out candles required to create a new candle).
2. The function initializes two variables: `hours` (the total number of hours the room can be lit) and `candles` (the current number of candles).
3. The function enters a loop where it calculates the number of hours the current candles can burn, updates the `hours` and `candles` variables, and calculates the number of new candles that can be created using the recycling process.
4. The loop continues until there are not enough candles to recycle.
5. The function returns the total number of hours the room can be lit.

### Note

This solution assumes that Vasily can recycle candles only when he has at least `b` burnt-out candles. If Vasily can recycle candles as soon as he has `b` burnt-out candles, the problem can be solved using a queue or a stack data structure. However, the problem statement implies that Vasily can only recycle candles when he has at least `b` burnt-out candles, so the iterative approach is sufficient.

Here's the solution to the problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    int totalHours = a;
    int remainingCandles = a;

    while (remainingCandles >= b) {
        int newCandles = remainingCandles / b;
        totalHours += newCandles;
        remainingCandles = newCandles + remainingCandles % b;
    }

    cout << totalHours;
    return 0;
}
```

Here's how this program works:

* We first initialize the total number of hours the candles can light up the room to `a`, since we start with `a` new candles.
* Then we calculate the number of remaining candles, which is initially also `a`.
* As long as we have enough remaining candles to make a new candle (`b` or more), we calculate how many new candles we can make (`newCandles = remainingCandles / b`).
* We then add these new candles to the total hours, since each new candle can light up the room for an hour.
* We update the remaining candles to be the new candles plus the candles that were not used to make new candles (`remainingCandles = newCandles + remainingCandles % b`).
* Once we no longer have enough remaining candles to make new candles, we stop the loop and print out the total hours.

For example, if `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the program would calculate the total hours as follows:

* Initially, we have `a = 5` new candles, so the total hours is `5`.
* Since we have `5` remaining candles and `b = 3`, we can make `1` new candle (`5 / 3 = 1`).
* We add `1` to the total hours, so the total hours is now `6`.
* We update the remaining candles to be `1` (the new candle) plus `2` (the remaining candles), so the remaining candles is now `3`.
* Since we have `3` remaining candles and `b = 3`, we can make `1` new candle (`3 / 3 = 1`).
* We add `1` to the total hours, so the total hours is now `7`.
* We update the remaining candles to be `1` (the new candle) plus `0` (the remaining candles), so the remaining candles is now `1`.
* Since we have only `1` remaining candle and `b = 3`, we cannot make any new candles, so we stop the loop and print out the total hours, which is `7`.

So the program would print `7`, which is the number of hours Vasily can light up the room with the given `a` and `b`.

**Problem Solution: Vasily's Candle Lighting Problem**

### Problem Overview

Vasily has a certain number of candles that can be used to illuminate his room. Each candle burns for an hour before going out. However, Vasily can make `b` went out candles into a new candle, which can be used like any other new candle. The goal is to find the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room if he acts optimally.

### Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we will use a recursive approach to calculate the maximum number of hours the candles can light up the room.

### Code Solution
```python
def calculate_hours(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room.

    Args:
    a (int): The initial number of candles.
    b (int): The number of went out candles required to make a new candle.

    Returns:
    int: The maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room.
    """
    total_hours = 0

    # Calculate the total number of hours
    total_hours += a  # Initial candles burn for an hour each

    # Calculate the remaining candles after the initial burn
    remaining_candles = a

    # Continue until there are not enough candles to make a new one
    while remaining_candles >= b:
        # Calculate the number of new candles that can be made
        new_candles = remaining_candles // b

        # Update the total hours
        total_hours += new_candles

        # Update the remaining candles
        remaining_candles = new_candles + (remaining_candles % b)

    return total_hours

# Example usage
a, b = map(int, input().split())
result = calculate_hours(a, b)
print(result)
```

### Explanation

1. The function `calculate_hours` takes two arguments: `a` (the initial number of candles) and `b` (the number of went out candles required to make a new candle).
2. The total number of hours is initialized to `a`, representing the initial burn of each candle.
3. The remaining candles after the initial burn are also set to `a`.
4. The function enters a while loop, which continues until there are not enough candles to make a new one (`remaining_candles < b`).
5. Inside the loop, the number of new candles that can be made is calculated by dividing the remaining candles by `b` and taking the integer part (`new_candles = remaining_candles // b`).
6. The total hours are updated by adding the number of new candles.
7. The remaining candles are updated by adding the new candles made and the candles that were not used to make new candles (`remaining_candles = new_candles + (remaining_candles % b)`).
8. Once the loop ends, the function returns the total number of hours.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the initial number of candles. The while loop runs until there are not enough candles to make a new one, which happens at most n times.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the total hours and the remaining candles.

### Vasily's Candle Problem Solution
#### Problem Description

Vasily has a certain number of candles that can burn for an hour before going out. He can recycle `b` burnt candles to create a new candle, which can then be used like any other new candle.

#### Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. The idea is to keep track of the number of candles available and the number of hours they can burn for.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:
```python
def vasily_candles(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the number of hours Vasily's candles can light up the room.

    Args:
        a (int): The initial number of candles.
        b (int): The number of burnt candles required to create a new candle.

    Returns:
        int: The number of hours the candles can light up the room.
    """
    hours = 0
    while a >= 1:
        # Burn the candles and add the hours
        hours += a
        # Calculate the number of new candles that can be created
        new_candles = (a + hours) // b
        # Update the number of candles available
        a = new_candles
    return hours

# Read the input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the answer
answer = vasily_candles(a, b)
print(answer)
```
#### Explanation

1. We initialize the `hours` variable to 0, which will keep track of the total hours the candles can burn for.
2. We enter a while loop that continues as long as there is at least one candle available (`a >= 1`).
3. Inside the loop, we add the number of candles available to the `hours` variable, since each candle can burn for an hour.
4. We calculate the number of new candles that can be created by recycling the burnt candles. We use integer division (`//`) to ensure that we get the largest whole number of new candles.
5. We update the number of candles available (`a`) to the number of new candles created.
6. We repeat steps 3-5 until there are no more candles available.
7. Finally, we return the total hours the candles can burn for.

#### Example Usage

Input:
```
10 2
```
Output:
```
17
```
This means that with 10 initial candles and a recycling rate of 2 burnt candles per new candle, Vasily's candles can light up the room for 17 hours.
