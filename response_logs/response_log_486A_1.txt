## Problem Solution: Calculating f(n) in O(1)
### Problem Overview

We are asked to calculate the value of a function `f(n)` defined as the alternating sum of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.

### Mathematical Formulation

The given function can be expanded as:
`f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + ... + ((-1)^n)*n`

This pattern resembles an alternating series, which we can analyze to find a more efficient way of computation.

### Geometric Sequence Summation Formula

The key observation is that the partial sums of the alternating series have a pattern. When `n` is even, the sum is `1`, and when `n` is odd, the sum is `-1`. However, this direct pattern observation doesn't directly lead to an efficient computation for large `n`.

To find a more efficient solution, consider the sum of the first `n` terms of the alternating sequence as two separate sums: one for the positive terms and one for the negative terms.

For an even `n`, there are `n/2` positive terms and `n/2` negative terms. The positive terms are the sum of an arithmetic sequence with the first term `a1 = 2`, the common difference `d = 2`, and `n/2` terms. Similarly, the negative terms form an arithmetic sequence with `a1 = -1`, `d = -2`, and `n/2` terms.

For an odd `n`, there are `(n+1)/2` positive terms and `(n-1)/2` negative terms, because the sequence starts with a negative term.

However, we can utilize a simpler mathematical pattern to solve this problem efficiently. The pattern involves the division of `n` into pairs of adjacent numbers, where each pair sums to 1.

### Solution

```python
def calculate_f_n(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the value of the function f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + ... + ((-1)^n)*n
    for a given positive integer n.

    Args:
    n (int): A positive integer.

    Returns:
    int: The value of f(n).
    """
    # If n is even, the sum can be calculated by pairing terms
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n // 2
    # If n is odd, the sum is one less than the number of pairs plus the last term
    else:
        return -(n // 2 + 1)

# Example usage
n = int(input())  # Read input
result = calculate_f_n(n)
print(result)     # Print the result
```

### Explanation

The provided Python function, `calculate_f_n`, takes an integer `n` as input and calculates `f(n)`.

For even `n`, we pair each negative term with the following positive term. Each pair sums to 1 (e.g., `-1 + 2 = 1`, `-3 + 4 = 1`), and there are `n/2` such pairs. Therefore, for even `n`, `f(n) = n/2`.

For odd `n`, we follow a similar pairing strategy but end up with an extra negative term at the beginning. Thus, the sum of all pairs plus the extra term gives us the result. Since there are `(n-1)/2` pairs and an extra negative term, the formula becomes `-(n/2 + 1/2)`, or simplified, `-(n+1)/2`.

However, considering that for odd `n`, the extra term at the end is actually positive (since `(-1)^n` alternates between -1 and 1, and for odd `n`, it's -1 for the terms positioned at even indices and 1 for the terms at odd indices, starting with 1 as the first index), we realize the need to adjust our thought process.

To correctly calculate `f(n)` for odd `n`, we observe that each pair still contributes 1 to the sum, and there are `(n-1)/2` such pairs. The last term, being positive and equal to `n`, adds to the sum of these pairs. The initial mistake in handling the last term for odd `n` is thus corrected: we simply have `(n-1)/2` pairs contributing positively, and the last term `n` also contributes positively because `n` is odd, making `(-1)^n = -1`, but since we're calculating the sum of the series up to `n`, we actually consider the sign of the term in the series, not the sign of `(-1)^n` as a standalone.

Given this, for odd `n`, the correct formula should indeed reflect the pairing and the final positive term, simplifying to `n // 2` when considering the net effect of pairing and the odd `n`'s last term.

Thus, the corrected understanding aligns with observing the pattern where each pair of consecutive terms in the sequence sums to 1, and handling the remainder based on whether `n` is odd or even to correctly calculate `f(n)`.

### Conclusion

The given solution efficiently calculates `f(n)` for any positive integer `n` using a mathematical insight into the pattern of alternating sums, achieving an O(1) time complexity.

## Calculating the Function f(n)
To calculate the function f(n) for a given integer n, we can observe that the series f(n) = -1 + 2 - 3 + .. + (-1)^n*n is an alternating series. We can break it down into pairs of consecutive terms and analyze the pattern.

## Pattern Analysis
When n is even, the series can be grouped into pairs as follows:
-1 + 2 = 1
-3 + 4 = 1
...
-(n-1) + n = 1

The number of such pairs is n/2, and each pair sums to 1.

When n is odd, the series has one extra term at the end:
-1 + 2 = 1
-3 + 4 = 1
...
-(n-2) + (n-1) = 1
+ n

The number of pairs is (n-1)/2, and there's an additional term -n if we were to pair it, but since we can't pair the last term, we simply keep it as is.

However, using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series isn't efficient for large n due to the need to iterate over all terms. We can use a mathematical approach to directly compute the sum.

## Deriving a Direct Formula
Notice that the series is an alternating series where each term increases by 1 in absolute value:
1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... + (-1)^n * n

We can pair terms (starting from the first term) to simplify the series:
(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + ((-1)^n * n)

However, for a direct and efficient computation, let's consider using the sum of the first n natural numbers and then apply the alternating pattern.

The sum of the first n natural numbers is n*(n+1)/2. We can see that for even n, the sum of the alternating series will be half of this sum, due to the pairing. For odd n, we add the last term to half the sum of the first (n-1) terms (since the series up to n-1 terms will have an even number of terms, making the sum of pairs directly calculable).

But for an even more direct approach:

Let's directly compute it using a different logic:
If n is even:
f(n) = (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + (n-1 - n)
f(n) = -1 - 1 - ... - 1 (n/2 times)
f(n) = -n/2

If n is odd:
f(n) = (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + (n-2 - (n-1)) + n
f(n) = -1 - 1 - ... - 1 ((n-1)/2 times) + n
f(n) = -(n-1)/2 + n
f(n) = (n - (n-1)/2)
f(n) = (2n - (n-1))/2
f(n) = (n + 1)/2

This simplification leads us to a direct formula for calculating f(n) based on whether n is even or odd.

## Implementation
Here is a Python solution implementing the derived formulas:
```python
def calculate_f_n(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:  # n is even
        return -n // 2
    else:  # n is odd
        return (n + 1) // 2

# Read input
n = int(input())

# Calculate f(n)
result = calculate_f_n(n)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Explanation
- The function `calculate_f_n(n)` calculates `f(n)` directly using the derived formulas.
- It checks if `n` is even or odd and applies the corresponding formula.
- The input `n` is read from the console.
- The result of `f(n)` is printed to the console.

This solution calculates `f(n)` in O(1) time complexity, making it efficient for large inputs up to `10^15`.
