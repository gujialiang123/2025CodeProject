**Gift Exchange Problem Solution**

### Problem Overview

The problem involves determining the friend who gave a gift to each friend, given a list of friends and the friend who each friend received a gift from.

### Solution

Here is a Python solution that reads the input and outputs the desired result:
```python
def solve_gift_exchange(n, gifts):
    """
    Determine the friend who gave a gift to each friend.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of friends.
    gifts (list[int]): A list of friends who received gifts from other friends.

    Returns:
    list[int]: A list of friends who gave gifts to each other friend.
    """
    giver = [0] * n
    for i, receiver in enumerate(gifts):
        giver[receiver - 1] = i + 1
    return giver

def main():
    n = int(input())  # Read the number of friends
    gifts = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of friends who received gifts
    result = solve_gift_exchange(n, gifts)
    print(*result)  # Print the result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
### Explanation

1. The `solve_gift_exchange` function takes two arguments: `n`, the number of friends, and `gifts`, a list of friends who received gifts from other friends.
2. The function initializes a list `giver` of length `n` to store the friend who gave a gift to each friend.
3. The function iterates over the `gifts` list, and for each friend `i`, it sets the corresponding value in the `giver` list to the friend who gave the gift to friend `i`. Note that we subtract 1 from the receiver's index because the problem statement uses 1-based indexing.
4. The `main` function reads the input, calls the `solve_gift_exchange` function, and prints the result.

### Example Use Case

Input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
Output:
```
2 3 1
```
In this example, friend 1 received a gift from friend 2, friend 2 received a gift from friend 3, and friend 3 received a gift from friend 1.

**Gift Exchange Problem Solution**
=====================================================

### Problem Description

Given a list of integers representing the friends who gave gifts to each other, find the friend who gave a gift to each friend.

### Solution

We can solve this problem by creating a simple mapping of friends to their gift givers.

#### Code Solution

```python
def find_gift_givers(n, gifts):
    """
    Find the friend who gave a gift to each friend.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of friends.
    gifts (list[int]): A list of integers representing the friends who gave gifts to each other.

    Returns:
    list[int]: A list of integers representing the friends who gave gifts to each other.
    """
    # Create a list to store the gift givers for each friend
    gift_givers = [0] * n

    # Iterate over the gifts and store the gift giver for each friend
    for i, gift in enumerate(gifts):
        gift_givers[gift - 1] = i + 1

    return gift_givers

def main():
    # Read the input
    n = int(input())
    gifts = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Find the gift givers
    gift_givers = find_gift_givers(n, gifts)

    # Print the gift givers
    print(' '.join(map(str, gift_givers)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Example Usage

Input:
```
5
2 3 4 5 1
```
Output:
```
5 1 2 3 4
```
Explanation:

* Friend 1 received a gift from friend 5.
* Friend 2 received a gift from friend 1.
* Friend 3 received a gift from friend 2.
* Friend 4 received a gift from friend 3.
* Friend 5 received a gift from friend 4.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of friends. This is because we iterate over the gifts once to store the gift givers.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of friends. This is because we create a list to store the gift givers for each friend.
