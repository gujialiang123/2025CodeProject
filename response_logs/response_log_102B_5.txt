**Problem Solution: Counting the Number of Spells Needed to Make a Number One-Digit**
===========================================================

### Problem Description

Gerald wants to practice magic by turning any number into the sum of its digits. We need to find out how many times Gerald needs to apply this spell until the number becomes one-digit.

### Solution

We can solve this problem by continuously applying the spell (summing the digits) until the number becomes one-digit. We'll store and manipulate the numbers as strings to avoid the limitations of Python's int type.

```python
def count_spells(n):
    """
    Counts the number of times a number needs to be replaced by the sum of its digits
    until it becomes one-digit.

    Args:
        n (str): The input number as a string.

    Returns:
        int: The number of spells needed.
    """
    count = 0
    while len(n) > 1:
        # Calculate the sum of the digits
        n = str(sum(int(digit) for digit in n))
        count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
n = input()  # Read the input number from the user
print(count_spells(n))  # Print the number of spells needed
```

### Explanation

1. The `count_spells` function takes a string `n` as input, representing the number.
2. We initialize a counter `count` to 0 to store the number of spells applied.
3. We enter a while loop that continues as long as the length of `n` is greater than 1 (i.e., the number is not one-digit).
4. Inside the loop, we calculate the sum of the digits of `n` using a generator expression and the built-in `sum` function. We convert each digit to an integer using `int(digit)`.
5. We assign the sum back to `n` as a string using `str(...)`.
6. We increment the `count` variable to keep track of the number of spells applied.
7. Once the while loop exits (i.e., `n` becomes one-digit), we return the `count` variable, which represents the number of spells needed.

### Example Use Case

Input:
```
12345
```
Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:

1. Apply the spell: `12345` -> `1+2+3+4+5 = 15` (1 spell)
2. Apply the spell: `15` -> `1+5 = 6` (1 spell)
The number becomes one-digit, so we output `2`, which is the number of spells needed.
