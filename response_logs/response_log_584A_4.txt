**Solution: Finding a Number that Satisfies Both Olesya and Rodion**

### Problem Analysis

Given the constraints of the problem, we need to find a number that consists of `n` digits and is divisible by `t`. We also need to consider cases where such a number may not exist.

### Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we will use a straightforward approach:

1. Check if `t` is a single-digit number (i.e., less than 10). If so, we can generate a number consisting of `n` digits with `t` as the first digit and zeros as the remaining digits.
2. If `t` is a two-digit number, we can only generate a number of the same length as `t`, which is 2. If `n` is not equal to 2, we output -1.

### Code Solution

```python
def find_number(n, t):
    """
    Find a number that satisfies both Olesya and Rodion.

    Args:
    n (int): The length of the number.
    t (int): The number that the result should be divisible by.

    Returns:
    int: A number that satisfies both Olesya and Rodion, or -1 if no such number exists.
    """
    # If t is a single-digit number, generate a number consisting of n digits
    if t < 10:
        # Generate a number with t as the first digit and zeros as the remaining digits
        result = int(str(t) + '0' * (n - 1))
        return result
    # If t is a two-digit number
    else:
        # Check if n is equal to 2
        if n == 2:
            # Return t as the result
            return t
        else:
            # If n is not equal to 2, return -1
            return -1

# Read input
n, t = map(int, input().split())

# Find and print the result
result = find_number(n, t)
print(result)
```

### Example Use Cases

* Input: `n = 3`, `t = 7`
Output: `700`
* Input: `n = 2`, `t = 10`
Output: `10`
* Input: `n = 1`, `t = 10`
Output: `-1`

## Solution
### Problem Overview
Given the length of a number `n` and a divisor `t`, find a number that satisfies both conditions: it has `n` digits and is divisible by `t`. If no such number exists, print `-1`.

### Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we will:
1. Check if `t` has `n` digits or less. If `t` is longer than `n` digits, there's no possible solution because `t` itself cannot be the number (it's at least `n+1` digits long).
2. If `t` is 1 digit long, we can always find a number of `n` digits that is divisible by `t` by simply repeating `t`.
3. For `t` with 2 digits, if `n` is 1, there's no solution because a single-digit number cannot be divisible by a two-digit number.

### Code Implementation
```python
def find_divisible_number(n, t):
    """
    Find a number with n digits that is divisible by t.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of digits.
    t (int): The divisor.
    
    Returns:
    int: A number with n digits divisible by t, or -1 if no such number exists.
    """
    
    # Convert t to a string for easier manipulation
    str_t = str(t)
    
    # If t has more digits than n, it's impossible to find a number
    if len(str_t) > n:
        return -1
    
    # If t is a single-digit number, repeat it n times
    if len(str_t) == 1:
        return int(str_t * n)
    
    # If n is 1 and t is 2 digits, no solution exists
    if n == 1 and len(str_t) == 2:
        return -1
    
    # If n is equal to the length of t, just return t
    if n == len(str_t):
        return t
    
    # If n is greater than the length of t, append zeros to t to make it n digits
    if n > len(str_t):
        return int(str_t + '0' * (n - len(str_t)))
    
    # Should never reach here, but for completeness
    return -1

# Example usage:
n, t = map(int, input().split())
print(find_divisible_number(n, t))
```

### Explanation
The provided Python code defines a function `find_divisible_number` that takes two parameters: `n` (the number of digits) and `t` (the divisor). It checks various conditions to determine if a number with `n` digits divisible by `t` exists and returns such a number or `-1` if no solution is found. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to call this function with user input.
