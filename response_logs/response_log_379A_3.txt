**Vasily's Candle Problem Solution**
=====================================

### Problem Analysis

Vasily has `a` initial candles and can create a new candle by recycling `b` old candles. The objective is to find the maximum number of hours the candles can light up the room.

### Solution Approach

We can approach this problem by using a simple iterative method to calculate the total hours the candles can light up the room. We'll keep track of the number of candles that have burned out and use them to create new candles.

### Code Solution

```python
def vasily_candles(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the maximum number of hours Vasily's candles can light up the room.

    Args:
        a (int): The initial number of candles.
        b (int): The number of old candles required to create a new candle.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of hours the candles can light up the room.
    """
    hours = a  # Initialize hours with the initial number of candles
    burned_candles = a  # Initialize burned candles with the initial number of candles

    while burned_candles >= b:
        # Calculate the number of new candles that can be created
        new_candles = burned_candles // b
        
        # Update the total hours
        hours += new_candles
        
        # Update the burned candles
        burned_candles = new_candles + (burned_candles % b)
    
    return hours

# Example usage:
a, b = map(int, input().split())  # Read input
print(vasily_candles(a, b))  # Print the result
```

### Explanation

1. The function `vasily_candles(a, b)` takes two arguments: `a` (the initial number of candles) and `b` (the number of old candles required to create a new candle).
2. The `hours` variable is initialized with the initial number of candles, and `burned_candles` is also initialized with the initial number of candles.
3. The while loop continues as long as there are enough burned candles to create a new candle (i.e., `burned_candles >= b`).
4. Inside the loop, the number of new candles that can be created is calculated using integer division (`burned_candles // b`).
5. The total hours are updated by adding the number of new candles.
6. The `burned_candles` variable is updated by adding the number of new candles and the remaining burned candles that were not used to create new candles (`burned_candles % b`).
7. Once the loop finishes, the function returns the total hours.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the initial number of candles. This is because the while loop runs for at most n iterations.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `hours`, `burned_candles`, `a`, and `b`.
