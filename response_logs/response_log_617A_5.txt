**Minimum Steps to Reach Friend's House**
=========================================

**Problem Description**
------------------------

An elephant wants to visit its friend located at point `x` on the coordinate line, where `x > 0`. The elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward in one step. We need to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house.

**Solution**
------------

This problem can be solved using a simple mathematical approach. Since the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward, we can divide the distance `x` by 5 and calculate the remainder. The quotient will give us the number of steps where the elephant moves 5 positions forward, and the remainder will give us the remaining distance to cover.

**Code Solution (Python)**
---------------------------

```python
def min_steps(x: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of steps to reach the friend's house.

    Args:
    x (int): The coordinate of the friend's house.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house.
    """
    # Calculate the number of steps where the elephant moves 5 positions forward
    steps_5 = x // 5
    
    # Calculate the remaining distance to cover
    remaining_distance = x % 5
    
    # If the remaining distance is 0, we don't need any additional steps
    if remaining_distance == 0:
        return steps_5
    else:
        # If the remaining distance is not 0, we need one additional step
        return steps_5 + 1

# Read the input
x = int(input())

# Calculate and print the minimum number of steps
print(min_steps(x))
```

**Example Use Cases**
----------------------

* Input: `x = 10`
  Output: `2` (The elephant can move 5 positions forward twice to reach point 10.)
* Input: `x = 7`
  Output: `2` (The elephant can move 5 positions forward once and then 2 positions forward to reach point 7.)
* Input: `x = 3`
  Output: `1` (The elephant can move 3 positions forward to reach point 3.)

**Explanation**
--------------

The provided Python code defines a function `min_steps` that calculates the minimum number of steps required to reach the friend's house. It uses integer division (`//`) to calculate the number of steps where the elephant moves 5 positions forward and the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the remaining distance. If the remaining distance is 0, the function returns the number of steps where the elephant moves 5 positions forward. Otherwise, it returns the number of steps where the elephant moves 5 positions forward plus one additional step to cover the remaining distance. The code then reads the input, calculates the minimum number of steps using the `min_steps` function, and prints the result.
