### Solution to Tanya's Subtraction Problem

#### Problem Description
Tanya has a unique way of subtracting one from a number. If the last digit is non-zero, she decreases the number by one. If the last digit is zero, she removes the last digit. Given an integer `n` and the number of subtractions `k`, we need to find the result after all `k` subtractions.

#### Solution
We can solve this problem by simulating Tanya's subtraction process `k` times. We will convert the number to a string to easily manipulate its digits.

```python
def tanya_subtraction(n, k):
    """
    Simulates Tanya's subtraction process k times.

    Args:
        n (int): The initial number.
        k (int): The number of subtractions.

    Returns:
        int: The result after all k subtractions.
    """
    # Convert the number to a string for easy manipulation
    num_str = str(n)
    
    # Perform k subtractions
    for _ in range(k):
        # Check if the last digit is zero
        if num_str[-1] == '0':
            # Remove the last digit
            num_str = num_str[:-1]
        else:
            # Decrease the number by one
            num_str = str(int(num_str) - 1)
    
    # Return the result as an integer
    return int(num_str)

# Example usage
n = 100
k = 4
result = tanya_subtraction(n, k)
print(result)
```

#### Explanation
1. We define a function `tanya_subtraction` that takes two arguments: `n` (the initial number) and `k` (the number of subtractions).
2. We convert the number `n` to a string `num_str` to easily manipulate its digits.
3. We perform `k` subtractions using a for loop.
4. Inside the loop, we check if the last digit of `num_str` is zero. If it is, we remove the last digit by slicing the string (`num_str[:-1]`).
5. If the last digit is not zero, we decrease the number by one by converting the string to an integer, subtracting one, and converting it back to a string.
6. After all `k` subtractions, we return the result as an integer by converting the final string `num_str` to an integer using `int()`.

**Problem Solution: Incorrect Subtraction**

### Problem Statement

Little girl Tanya is learning how to decrease a number by one, but she does it wrong with a number consisting of two or more digits. Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:
* if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one;
* if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit).
Given an integer number `n` and an integer `k`, subtract one from `n` `k` times using Tanya's algorithm and print the result.

### Solution

Here is a Python solution to the problem:
```python
def incorrect_subtraction(n, k):
    """Subtract one from n k times using Tanya's algorithm"""
    for _ in range(k):
        if n % 10 == 0:
            n = n // 10
        else:
            n -= 1
    return n

def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    result = incorrect_subtraction(n, k)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
### Explanation

The solution consists of a single function `incorrect_subtraction(n, k)` that takes two integers `n` and `k` as input and returns the result of subtracting one from `n` `k` times using Tanya's algorithm.

The function uses a simple loop that iterates `k` times. Inside the loop, it checks if the last digit of `n` is zero. If it is, it divides `n` by 10 using integer division `//`. Otherwise, it decrements `n` by 1.

The `main()` function reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input using the `input()` function and splits them into separate variables using the `map()` function. It then calls the `incorrect_subtraction()` function with the two integers and prints the result.

### Example Use Cases

* Input: `123 4`
Output: `119`
* Input: `120 2`
Output: `12`
* Input: `100 3`
Output: `1`

Note that the solution assumes that the input values of `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 50) and that the result will be a positive integer.
